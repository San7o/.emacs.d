His blog is <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/\">Melting Asphalt</a>. </em></p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Of all the problems that can plague a discussion of beauty — and there are several — perhaps the most damning is how to define the word, to find a sturdy concept worthy of the label.</p><p>Look no further than the debates over whether beauty is “objective” or “subjective.” Is it <em>out there</em> in the world, or <em>in here</em> in our minds? When we can’t agree on this most fundamental distinction, we're not talking about the same thing.</p><p>I’ve been mulling over the idea of beauty recently, letting the word glide around over many possible meanings. It took a while, but I finally found one that clicked. Unlike the other meanings I’ve toyed with, this one is tangible and solid; it keeps its shape. I’ve had a lot of fun playing around with it, and I’m going to share it with you today.</p><p>But please, understand that I’m not trying to <a href=\"https://everythingstudies.com/2018/02/12/wordy-weapons-of-is-ought-alloy/\">annex the word</a>, to repurpose it to point toward my preferred concept. I don’t particularly care what other people mean when they talk about “beauty”; I have no dog in that fight. I just want to describe something that happens in the world, something I think is fascinating. And the best label I can think to give it is “beauty.”</p><p>Are you with me?</p><p>Here’s a little preview of where we’re headed: I want to talk about beauty as a game. Specifically, a two-player game. Or to be maximally precise: <em>a family of games with two main player classes</em>.</p><p>It will make sense soon, I promise.</p><p>In the meantime, please leave your semantic baggage at home, put on your <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/nat-epis/\">Quinean naturalist’s</a> hat (ideally with a bright feather in it), and let’s head out on a little armchair safari.</p><h3>Desire</h3><p>As a way of approaching this thing we want to talk about — “beauty” — we’ll begin with a simpler phenomenon. Whenever a creature observes something, gets a good feeling, and is attracted to it, let’s call that <em>desire</em>.</p><p>The phenomenon of desire — attraction mediated by perception — describes many of the basic low-level instincts that animals have. So we can speak of the <em>desire</em> for food and the <em>desire</em> for sex, to give some paradigmatic examples. But we can also say that mother animals <em>desire</em> their children, and vice versa. Or that a squirrel, looking up at a nice perch, <em>desires</em> it as a place to rest.</p><p>For our purposes today, no special cognitive complexity or inner experience is required. Even a lowly insect can be the subject of desire — as a dragonfly toward its mate, for example, or a dung beetle toward a piece of dung.</p><p>It’s not hard to see how desires like these can be adaptive, i.e., the kinds of features sculpted by natural selection. We can even see this in our own species. Smooth skin is a sign of good health, whereas boiling skin is a sign of disease, and so we evolved to desire the former and be disgusted by the latter. A ripe strawberry is nutritious, whereas deer droppings are not, and desire helps us choose between them. One of these landscapes is better suited for humans — and which are you drawn toward?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"404\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":404,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Not every desire is adaptive, of course; our sensibilities often lead us astray.

But often the player’s brain isn’t flexible enough, so the learning takes place in the species’ genome via natural selection; in that case, the player is actually the entire species. Either way, Desire eventually learns what to approach and what to avoid.</p><p>Now we could stop here and declare that <em>beauty = whatever triggers good feelings in a Desire player</em>. This would be a perfectly sensible definition: if something appeals to you, it’s beautiful, end of story. This is the kind of beauty that people say is “in the eye of the beholder,” where each creature develops its own subjective tastes. The dung beetle can find dung “beautiful” while we find it disgusting, and there's no tension whatever between these two facts.</p><p>This definition of beauty would make a fine concept — <em>if</em> we were diligent about hewing to it. It’s just that games of solitaire are boring, so the word we’re attempting to pin down keeps slipping off for more exciting meanings, for denotations with sexier connotations.</p><p>Specifically, it’s when a second player enters the field — a player who produces something <em>deliberately</em> to attract the Desire player — that things really start to heat up.</p><h3>Player Two</h3><p>By way of introducing the second player, consider this brief visual history of plant life on Earth. We’ll start with the earliest single-celled organisms and work our way down to plant species in the present day.</p><p>So, Earth is 4.5 billion years old.

But when we step back and take the long view, we can see that they’re a <em>dramatic departure</em> from previous forms of plant life. Where everything else is drab and boring, a flower is bold and showy. While other plant organs are strictly utilitarian, a flower goes out of its way to be noticed. It’s a bid for visual attention in a world that’s otherwise oblivious to the gaze of others.</p><p>This is player two, AKA the Beauty player:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

For fertilization, a plant needs to get its pollen (i.e., plant sperm) over to another plant of the same species. Before flowers, plants did this by releasing their pollen in water or on the wind, hoping it would land in the right place. But this is a scattershot approach, error-prone and exceptionally wasteful. The genius of flowering plants was figuring out how to move pollen precisely and reliably by recruiting <em>animals</em> as their couriers. These are our Desire players, and in the context of flowering plants, they’re called <em>pollinators</em>. The most iconic pollinator, of course, is the honeybee. But the role can be filled by many other insects (like butterflies), as well as birds (hummingbirds) and even mammals (bats).</p><p>This relationship is simple, but also profound. The plant lures the pollinator with the promise of food (e.g., nectar). And when a plant consistently delivers on its promise, the pollinator keeps coming back. Not just to the very same plant, but to other plant of the same species, thus ensuring an extremely high fertilization efficiency.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> And the flower mediates this relationship by acting as a <em>brand image</em>. Its distinctive shape and arresting colors are a mnemonic to remind pollinators of the plant’s good faith and credit. “Get your sweet nectar here!” the flower calls out, “And wherever else you see our trademarked signs!”</p><p>Thus the flower’s beauty isn’t capricious. It’s a solution to a very concrete problem.</p><p>And what a solution it turned out to be! Since bursting on the scene some 130 million years ago, flowering plants have completely taken over from their predecessors, such that they now dominate the landscape. It’s estimated that flowering plants make up 90 percent of all plant species and more than half of all biomass on Earth.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> That’s the power of beauty.</p><h3>A game for two players</h3><p>Here, then, is our game.

In both games, Desire’s goal is to learn which perceptual cues are good vs. bad. So as the bee buzzes around, it uses its aesthetic sense to decide where to land — and when it sees something that tickles its brain in the right way, it flies toward it. But the bee doesn’t particularly care that the flower was made by an adaptive Beauty player. If nectar started bubbling up from the ground, the bee would be just as happy, and would soon develop a preference for cracks and fissures rather than flowers.</p><p>The Beauty player, however, can’t play solitaire. The whole point of Beauty is to make something Desire wants, to trigger the <em>oooh</em>-circuits in Desire’s brain. Without Desire, there’d be no audience for Beauty’s performance, and no reason for it to make anything beautiful.</p><p>The metaphor of <em>lock and key</em> might be helpful here. Desire’s brain acts like a lock, and only certain perceptual cues will fit the lock and engage the attraction response. Beauty, then, has to produce something that works as a key:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\" width=\"1324\" height=\"390\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":390,\"width\":1324,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But whereas a physical lock-and-key system is engineered all at once, Desire and Beauty coevolve slowly. Their dance goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>The Desire player starts by playing solitaire, and evolves perceptual preferences that help in its environment. For example, an insect might develop a slight attraction to round shapes and/or bright colors (for reasons that have nothing to do with flowers).</p></li><li><p>A nascent Beauty player then evolves a form to deliberately target those preferences — a key that fits Desire’s lock. At first the form will only work as a weak trigger, but over time Beauty will learn to make stronger and stronger stimuli, like brighter colors and more symmetrical petals.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile, as long as the Beauty player continues to reward the Desire player (e.g., by feeding it nectar), then Desire will develop an even stronger preference for the relevant stimuli. What was initially just a slight bias will become a fixation.</p></li><li><p>If this relationship is fruitful, other Beauty players will inevitably try to get in on the action. And thus each Beauty player will need to <em>outcompete</em> its rivals by producing something that works as an even stronger trigger to the Desire player.</p></li></ol><p>And so on. This positive feedback loop — Desire chasing Beauty in realtime and Beauty chasing Desire over evolutionary time — is what drives the production of beauty in every nook and cranny of the natural world:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\" width=\"1454\" height=\"946\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":946,\"width\":1454,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Please note: This is not a Grand Unified Theory of beauty. There are many important questions not addressed by this framing — for example, questions about taste and class, or which forms of beauty are sublime vs. merely kitsch. The idea of beauty-as-game will happily endorse both a Rembrandt and a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=thomas+kinkade&num=20&source=lnms&tbm=isch\">Thomas Kinkade</a> as “beautiful” — and if that’s a problem, you’ll have to seek distinctions elsewhere. Instead, the perspective offered here will help answer questions like <em>Why does beauty grow?</em> and <em>Under what conditions is beauty stable?</em> Or even, <em>How will beauty behave on other planets?</em></p><p>It’s about, in Sarah Perry’s phrase, the <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/12/03/an-ecology-of-beauty-and-strong-drink/\">ecology of beauty</a>.</p><p>Of course, no two beauty games are identical. They’re played in different media and different environments, and the economic relationships between the players can differ wildly from game to game. But there’s enough in common across all games that they’re worth examining together; they constitute a family. And that’s what we’re here to study.</p><h3>Two-player beauty in animals</h3><p>Now when I mentioned flowers earlier, I may have given the impression that they were the first Beauty players on Earth. Actually they're just the first in the plant kingdom. Whereas <em>animals</em> have been playing Beauty with other animals for quite a bit longer — maybe 300 million years longer, give or take.</p><p>When animals play beauty with each other, they almost always do it in the context of <em>sexual selection</em>, that is, in the competition for mates. Sexual selection typically occurs in polygynous species, where the males compete for opportunities to mate with the females. This kind of competition doesn’t always produce beauty; often it results in raw male-on-male aggression. But in species where it’s harder for males to dominate the females — i.e., when females have more choice — males must compete to <em>attract</em> potential mates.

That’s what’s easy to show on a web page. But it leaves out all the songs, dances, smells, and other attributes and behaviors that can’t be rendered as JPEGs. These forms of beauty are just as important to animals and are equally shaped by sexual selection. And the process is similar: preexisting perceptual biases in the female (Desire) player become an evolutionary target for the male (Beauty) player. For instance, a slight preference for certain sounds in the female nightingale’s auditory cortex is what induces the male nightingale to evolve its famous songs.</p><p>The media may be different, but the mechanics are the same. Within a given generation, female Desire players chase male Beauty players. But across generations, male traits evolve to target female preferences.</p><h3>Human beauty games</h3><p>But what about us? Do we also play beauty as a kind of mating dance?</p><p>We are animals, after all. And so it’s not surprising that we can pattern-match some of our activities to sexual selection driven by female choice. But it seems just as often to go the other way around, where women compete as the Beauty players vis-à-vis male Desire.</p><p>Sexual selection does sometimes occur in a monogamous species (ours being more or less deserving of the label). In such cases, males and females play both roles, Desire and Beauty; each makes a display for the other to admire and choose. Hence the ornaments <em>and</em> the eye for ornament among both sexes in the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/15/3/380/217125\">black swan</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/362238a0\">crested auklet</a>. And perhaps in our species as well.</p><p>But try as we might to pin a mating agenda on all human beauty production, it doesn’t always fit. Heterosexual men enjoy beautiful things made by other men, just as women enjoy performing for other women.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> Even very young children have an aesthetic sense.

Other forms include songs, dances, poetry, novels, and pretty much any other thing that’s considered an art form. A few forms that are less often referred to as “beautiful” (but still, I think, fit the bill) include perfumes, Swedish massages, and elegant mathematical proofs.</p><p>So if not sexual selection alone, what occasions all these varied and refined forms of beauty in our species?</p><p>I’ve thought about this quite a bit over the years. And increasingly I’m convinced that much of what makes humans unique — including our taste in beauty — is our hunger for prestige.</p><p>I’ve written a lot about prestige status in the past, so I don’t want to belabor the point for long-time readers. But allow me a few words, briefly, to get us all on the same page.</p><p><em>Prestige</em> is a form of social status, and the best way to understand it is to contrast it with <em>dominance</em>. Together, these two phenomena make up most of what we think of as social status. Dominance is based on fear (who can hurt me?), whereas prestige is based on attraction (who can help me?). Dominance, of course, is found throughout the animal kingdom: alpha males, pecking orders, hierarchies, etc. Prestige is a bit harder to spot, but tends to arise in species that <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/minimum-viable-superorganism/\">coordinate their efforts in small groups</a> — for example, wolves, lions, meerkats, and birds like the <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/\">Arabian babbler</a>. But no one does prestige like <em>Homo sapiens</em>. For reasons that are out of scope for this essay, human life allows enormous returns to cooperation, unprecedented (apart from the social insects) in the animal kingdom. And much of this cooperation is mediated by prestige.</p><p>Here’s what’s important for beauty: Prestige — like pollination and sexual selection — is a game of attraction in which Beauty players compete to attract free-choosing Desire players. Just as the flower blooms for the bee, and just as a peacock angles for the eye of the peahen, so do humans compete for the attentions and affections of our peers. And just as this game produces incredible ornaments in petals and feathers, so does it yield spectacular results in the media we control:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":600,\"width\":800,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is one reason we tend to find so much beauty in contexts governed by prestige, e.g., in museums, galleries, temples, palaces, and monuments, as well as in our homes (architecture, decor) and on our persons (body art, fashion). Even money — a distillation of prestige — probably evolved out of objects, <a href=\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/\">like seashells and shiny metals</a>, collected in part for their beauty.</p><p>By way of an archetype, consider a powerful nobleman in feudal Europe, circa 1500, trying to govern his lands and expand his influence. On the one hand (dominance), he’ll want to strike an imposing figure, both in the way he carries himself and in his <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/09/04/projected-presence/\">projected presence</a>. But no man rules by dominance alone; every leader finds use for the carrot as well as the stick. So on the other hand (prestige), our feudal lord will also benefit by putting his friendlier qualities on display.</p><p>Consider, in particular, the nobleman’s dining hall. Here he will host a variety of guests, all of whom he might hope to influence in some way. And the more time they spend in <em>his</em> venue (rather than, say, dining with his rivals), the more favor he’ll be able to curry. But all of his guests have other choices for where to spend their time, so he must provide a venue that people positively enjoy. And one of the best strategies here is to make and display beauty. The food and drink, of course, must be exquisite. But he’ll also commission rich tapestries for the walls and elegant chandeliers for the ceiling. Perhaps he’ll even hire musicians and dancers to entertain people before and after the meal. His guests are like honeybees, so he must be like a flower.</p><h3>Pop Quiz</h3><p>We’ve now seen how three entirely different ecologies — plant fertilization, sexual selection, and prestige status — give rise to games of multiplayer beauty. I hope these have given you an intuitive grasp of the phenomena in question. But just in case, here’s a little quiz to make sure we’re all on the same page.</p><p>In what follows, I’m going to show a series of images. Each image depicts something that the average person might see as “beautiful” or in some way appealing. Tastes vary, of course, but for this exercise, we’re not asking <em>whether</em> each thing is beautiful. Instead, we’re taking its beauty as given and asking <em>why</em> it’s beautiful — i.e., whether its beauty arises from <em>single-player</em> or <em>multiplayer</em> dynamics. In other words, are we attracted to it because we learned to appreciate it unilaterally (single-player), or because it was specifically designed for us to appreciate (multiplayer)?</p><p>Alright, here we go.</p><p><strong>Blue sky</strong>: single or multiplayer beauty?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":667,\"width\":1000,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A: Well, the sky didn’t become blue in order to appeal to humans.

In their native habitat, crystals arise entirely on their own, without any coupling to a Desire player. But their native habitat is buried deep in a cave, or else locked inside a geode — i.e., out of sight. So when regular people like you and me actually lay eyes on a crystal, it’s typically because someone else — a human Beauty player — went and dug it up, knowing it would appeal to us.

The fact that we find this part of a dandelion beautiful is largely a coincidence — a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_(biology)\">spandrel</a>. Certainly the dandelion head didn’t evolve for us: it’s a device for scattering seeds on the wind, not a lure for us (or any animal) to engage with it. Nor, I think, did we evolve any special eyes for the dandelion. Instead, dandelions give off perceptual cues (like symmetry and repetition of form) that happen to coincide with strategies used by bona fide Beauty players for which we may have coevolved an appreciation.</p><p>Note that this shouldn’t in any way tarnish our appreciation of the dandelion. Whatever the underlying cause, it still tickles the beauty centers in our brains. But insofar as we’re calling attention to the <em>game mechanics</em> that underlie beauty, it must be noted that there’s no coupling between our desire circuits and the dandelion form. Neither is chasing the other.</p><p>In fact, the same can be said for our relationship to flowers more generally. Flowers are playing multiplayer beauty with <em>pollinators</em>, clearly, but why they happen to appeal to <em>us</em> is a <a href=\"https://publicism.info/science/infinity/15.html\">fascinating open question</a>.</p><p>OK, last one.</p><p><strong>Tree branches and leaves</strong>: single or multiplayer beauty?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\" width=\"774\" height=\"612\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":612,\"width\":774,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A: It has to be single-player... right?

Often the two mechanics are happening simultaneously, and we can see one or the other depending on which frame or level of analysis we choose to apply. As a final frame-shift, consider approaching the images above as photographs. From that perspective, they’re all products of a multiplayer game (where photographers act as deliberate Beauty players). But these nuances not­with­stan­ding, I maintain that the two mechanics — single- and multiplayer beauty — are analytically distinct, and can (and should) be understood separately.</p><p>Alright, thanks for playing. Back to our regular program.</p><h3>Independent vs. Correlated Desire</h3><p>Now that we have a handle on beauty as a multiplayer game, I want to illustrate what these concepts are capable of. Specifically, I want to show some of the questions that can arise from this framework.</p><p>To that end, let’s compare and contrast a <em>honeybee</em> and a <em>fine art collector</em>. Two very different creatures, and yet both are Desire players in games of multiplayer beauty. Both are attracted, by way of their aesthetic sense, to deliberate Beauty products — flowers in the case of bees, artworks in the case of the collector. And both hope to be rewarded for their pursuit of beauty, whether in nectar or in money/​prestige.</p><p>That said, bees and art collectors face very different incentives vis-à-vis other Desire players in their respective games.</p><p>Specifically, the honeybee gets to make its choice (of which flower to pursue) entirely on its own, without regard for what the other bees are doing. A bee’s only concern is whether a flower has nectar, not whether any other bees are also attracted to it.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> In contrast, an art collector must <em>not</em> follow her own instincts in isolation, or she risks investing in something that has no market value. Instead, in the fine art world, it pays to have broadly the same tastes as everyone else (unless you’re buying art for personal consumption, e.g., to hang in your bedroom).</p><p>Let’s say that pollination is a game of <em>Independent Desire</em> whereas art collection is a game of <em>Correlated Desire</em>. The distinction is whether the rewards that accrue to a Desire player depend on what the other Desire players are doing.

In order to grow something so big and bright and highly-ordered, the peacock must be a hearty specimen with good genes. And thus the benefit to the <em>peahen</em> is fairly straightforward: by choosing a beautiful mate, she’ll tend to have healthier, heartier offspring — who will, in turn, leave her more grandchildren.</p></blockquote><p>In this story, peahens are playing a game of Independent Desire. Each gets to choose the mate she considers the healthiest (i.e., most beautiful), without regard to what her peers are doing.</p><p>The other story goes like this:</p><blockquote><p>A peacock’s tail is <em>not</em> an honest signal of his fitness. Whatever heartiness is required to produce the tail is cancelled out by the hassle of lugging it around — so males with small, drab tails are just as good at surviving as males with big, bright ones. Instead, a peahen who desires flashy tails is rewarded because <em>other peahens</em> also desire those tails — and therefore the <em>sons</em> that she makes with her beautiful mate will tend to be desired when it’s their turn to reproduce.</p></blockquote><p>In evolutionary biology, this is called <em>runaway sexual selection</em>. And if it sounds circular, well, that’s because it is. In runaway selection, the initial female desire is entirely arbitrary, but it gets fixed within a population simply because everyone else is doing it. Think of it as a self-reinforcing popularity loop. There may be no reason for the initial popularity, but once bright tails become popular, they can remain popular indefinitely (because any female who mates with an ugly/​unpopular mate will have ugly/​unpopular sons). This is a game of Correlated Desire.</p><p>So then, in the case of peafowl, which is it? Did the peacock’s tail evolve in response to Independent Desire (honest signaling) or Correlated Desire (runaway selection)?</p><p>At the risk of being a wet blanket, I suspect it’s a bit of both. So instead of trying to adjudicate, I’d like to make some general remarks about how to determine which type of game is being played, Independent or Correlated Desire.</p><p>On the Desire side, games of Correlated Desire reward herdthink. In sexual selection, we see this as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice_copying\">mate choice copying</a>, where females watch other females to see which males they choose, then copy the most popular choices.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> In the human realm, herdthink shows up as <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/\">mimetic desire</a>, where people want things largely because other people want them as well.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><p>But what about the Beauty side? Do the forms of beauty that evolve in the two types of games differ in systematic ways? Perhaps, although I don’t know how strong the effect is. In games of Independent Desire, beauty solves a concrete problem: how to induce a Desire player into a relationship with a Beauty player. And thus there are constraints on the forms that such beauty can take. For example, a flower has to be bright and stand out from the background in order for pollinators to see it from afar. However, in games of Correlated Desire, the objects desired by the herd can take on more arbitrary forms, resulting in a kind of hollow or degenerate beauty — things that are desired only because everyone else desires them (or is thought to desire them), rather than for their intrinsic qualities. (See for example much of contemporary art and architecture.) In these cases, beauty can persist because of the network effect (self-reinforcing popularity), but there’s nevertheless something fragile about it. Biology nerds may recognize this as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_paradox\">lek paradox</a>, while economists will see some of the problems with fiat currencies (e.g., that governments often have to prop them up by artificial means).

The flower is playing an <em>iterated, positive-sum game</em> with the bee, and beauty is crucial to the relationship. Specifically, the flower <em>wants to stand out</em>, because having bold colors and a distinctive shape makes it easier for the bee to find it — to remember that the flower was a good collaborator in the past and to recognize it later down the road.</p><p>Now think about the flytrap. In contrast to the flower, it’s decidedly <em>not</em> playing a positive-sum game with the insects that visit it. So the more it stands out, the easier it will be for insects to learn to <em>avoid</em> it — the very opposite of what it wants. And thus it <em>doesn’t</em> benefit from calling visual attention to itself, from being beautiful.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a></p><p>More generally, predators and prey exist in the wrong game-theoretical relationship, i.e., one of exploitation. This is not conducive to beauty. Instead, beauty arises from a <em>collaboration</em> between a Beauty player and a Desire player.</p><p>Fun fact: many carnivorous plants also make flowers. But note that they take pains to keep their two activities separate. Their flowers look nothing like their mouths, and they hoist the flowers high up off the ground (away from their sticky parts) so their pollinators won’t accidentally get eaten. Like any agent interested in sustained collaboration, they learn not to prey on their partners:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":678,\"width\":1024,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>If this analysis generalizes — and I think it does — the conclusion is startling: <em>Beauty is typically good</em>. More precisely, the Beauty role works best for agents pursuing <em>win-win</em> interactions with Desire players.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> Agents with “bad” intentions (those who intend to hurt the Desire players) generally don’t benefit from investing in beauty and calling attention to themselves. Instead they try to hide and blend in.</p><p>The main exception to this rule, and it’s a significant one, is the existence of mimics and counterfeits. These players — we might consider them a third player type, the Cheat — copy the distinctive forms worked out by honest Beauty players in their pursuit of Desire. But whereas an honest Beauty player somehow provides a benefit to the Desire player, the Cheat does not. For example, one orchid species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/305799a0\">masquerades</a> as a bellflower — but only the bellflower rewards its pollinators with nectar. The orchid just mooches off of their productive relationship.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"813\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":813,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In general, though, cheaters can only exist in a world paved by honest players, and the extent to which they can cheat is limited by the success of the strategy they exploit. Without the bellflower to reinforce pollinators, the orchid would have nothing to gain by making a nectar-free flower. And when mimicry becomes too easy, the entire niche collapses, cheats and honest players alike. And thus, <em>in the limit</em>, beauty tends to be good.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>Well there’s a lot more to say, but I’ve gone on long enough.</p><p>For those of you interested in exploring further, I’ve left some threads to pull on in the addendum below (“To ponder”). For everyone else, I hope I’ve demoed how to approach beauty as an ecological phenomenon. It’s not about debating whether a given object is or isn’t beautiful. Nor is the goal to identify the Platonic essence of beauty. Instead, it’s about exploring the ecologies in which beauty grows.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"832\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":832,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ebca78-6246-40b0-b005-c5ea1c57ef84_1614x922.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nsbarr\">Nick Barr</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/everytstudies\">John Nerst</a>, and Charles Feng for feedback on a draft of this essay, and to Forrest Bennett and Diana Huang for some great conversations about beauty.</p><h3><strong>To ponder</strong></h3><p>I don’t know the answers to these questions, but they seem worth thinking about:</p><ul><li><p>What explains the common strategies used by Beauty players in their production of beauty? E.g., clean lines, smooth surfaces, symmetry, repetition of forms, intricacy, elaboration, rich colors, strong contrasts. Are there underlying principles here? In particular, I'm intrigued by the idea of beauty products as proofs-of-work.</p></li><li><p>Why are flowers, which evolved to attract insects and other small animals, so attractive to us? Why do we find flowers beautiful? Three possible answers: (1) Coincidence. (2) “Standing out” is the main factor, and both pollinators and humans appreciate when something stands out. (3) Both pollinators and humans use similar standards for evaluating proofs-of-work, because these standards are somewhat universal. Of these, (3) is the most interesting, but I can’t rule out (1) or (2).</p></li><li><p>What happens when you introduce Desire players with an appetite for novelty? How does that change the gameplay?</p></li><li><p>Are deep sea creatures <em>objectively</em> uglier than their shallow-water counterparts?</p></li><li><p>Why are desserts, relative to main courses, more often a vehicle for beauty? (I’m not sure there’s a good answer here, but it seems tantalizing.)</p></li><li><p>Why does it feel morally wrong to see beauty emerging from evil places, like the architecture and pageantry of the Third Reich?</p></li><li><p>How do the different sensory modalities influence how beauty is expressed in them? In particular, sight, sound, and smell can operate at a distance, whereas taste and touch can only operate up close. For a game based on attraction, this seems relevant. C.f. Denis Dutton’s remark: “Beauty is nature’s way of acting at a distance.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>Photo credits</strong></p><p>Most were blatantly copied from random Google image searches.

Francesca Minerva, Jeff Mcmahan, and Peter Singer so that low-rent philosophers could publish articles in defense of <a href=\"https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/3/1/233\">black-face Halloween costumes</a>, <a href=\"https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/1/1/137\">animal rights terrorism</a>, and having <a href=\"https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/3/2/255\">sex with animals</a>. I, for one, am appalled. The JoCI and its cute little articles are far too tame; we simply must do better.</p><p>Thus, I propose <em>The Journal of Dangerous Ideas</em> (the JoDI). I suppose it doesn’t go without saying in this case, but I believe that the creation of such a journal, and the call to thought which it represents, will be to the benefit of all mankind.</p><h2>What is a dangerous idea?</h2><p>an idea whose birthing harms the world; an idea whose existence represents a threat to persons or creatures (the good ones, not the bad ones that should be threatened); an idea which possesses the quality of being dangerous (like hardcore porn, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it\">you know it when you see it</a>”).</p><p>I reckon there are many ways in which an idea can be dangerous: technologically dangerous of course, but also scientifically dangerous, philosophically dangerous, socially dangerous, artistically dangerous, spiritually dangerous, and so on and so forth.</p><h3>Some Examples</h3><ul><li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11167\">The Journal of Dangerous Ideas</a></em><a

The balls represent possible ideas, discoveries, technological inventions. Over the course of history, we have extracted a great many balls— mostly white (beneficial) but also various shades of gray (moderately harmful ones and mixed blessings). The cumulative effect on the human condition has so far been overwhelmingly positive, and may be much better still in the future.</p><p>What we haven’t extracted, so far, is a black ball: a technology that invariably or by default destroys the civilization that invents it. The reason is not that we have been particularly careful or wise in our technology policy. We have just been lucky.</p><p>—Nick Bostrom, “<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">The Vulnerable World Hypothesis</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Let’s borrow Bostrom’s scheme and adapt it as follows:</p><h4>Light balls</h4><ul><li><p>White balls—beneficial ideas</p></li><li><p>Light grey balls—mixed blessings (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology\">dual-use</a>)</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Dark balls</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Dark grey balls</strong>—moderately harmful (e.g. a new scamming method)</p></li><li><p><strong>Black balls</strong>—truly pernicious species-altering or -ending ideas (Bostrom gives the example of “easy nukes” in his paper: suppose it became relatively trivial and cheap for a small group of adults to build a nuclear bomb)</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Two questions:</strong></h4><ol><li><p>Would the JoDI increase the overall amount of harm done from <strong>dark balls</strong>?</p></li><li><p>Would the JoDI increase the total benefit from drawing white balls enough to offset any increased levels of harm from <strong>dark balls</strong>?</p></li></ol><p>In regards to the first question, it seems likely that the JoDI would, simply by virtue of its existence, inspire us to grab more <strong>dark balls</strong> from the urn. But for these balls to cause harm, they must “fall into the wrong hands”, so to speak. It seems plausible to that the JoDI could cause a drop in the rate of <strong>dark balls</strong> grabbed or possessed by bad actors because more good actors will be reaching for <strong>dark balls</strong>. While too much oversight defeats the entire purpose of the journal, it might make sense to have some kind of initial screening process whereby sufficiently dangerous <strong>black balls</strong> can be kept under wraps and routed to the appropriate authorities/experts. This screening process presents its own serious concerns and questions (who watches the watchers?), but it should still increase the chances that a <strong>black ball</strong> is pulled in the safest possible manner. For lighter and less dangerous orbs, publication can obviate the idea’s element of surprise and give us a head start on developing new safety or security technologies, regulations, counter-arguments, cultural movements, etc.</p><h2>White Balls</h2><p>H. P. Lovecraft, writing to Edwin Baird, the first editor of <em>Weird Tales</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Popular authors do not and apparently cannot appreciate the fact that true art is obtainable only by rejecting normality and conventionality in toto, and approaching a theme purged utterly of any usual or preconceived point of view. Wild and “different” as they may consider their quasi-weird products, it remains a fact that the bizarrerie is on the surface alone; and that basically they reiterate the same old conventional values and motives and perspectives. Good and evil, teleological illusion, sugary sentiment, anthropocentric psychology—the usual superficial stock in trade, and all shot through with the eternal and inescapable commonplace….</p><p>Whoever wrote a story from the point of view that man is a blemish on the cosmos, who ought to be eradicated? As an example—a young man I know lately told me that he means to write a story about a scientist who wishes to dominate the earth, and who to accomplish his ends trains and overdevelops germs…and leads armies of them in the manner of the Egyptian plagues. I told him that although this theme has promise, it is made utterly commonplace by assigning the scientist a normal motive. There is nothing <em>outré </em>about wanting to conquer the earth; Alexander, Napoleon, and Wilhelm II wanted to do that. Instead, I told my friend, he should conceive a man with a morbid, frantic, shuddering hatred of the life-principle itself, who wishes to extirpate from the planet every trace of biological organism, animal and vegetable alike, including himself. That would be tolerably original. But after all, originality lies with the author. One can’t write a weird story of real power without perfect psychological detachment from the human scene, and a magic prism of imagination which suffuses theme and style alike with that grotesquerie and disquieting distortion characteristic of morbid vision. Only a cynic can create horror—for behind every masterpiece of the sort must reside a driving demonic force that despises the human race and its illusions, and longs to pull them to pieces and mock them.</p></blockquote><p>Lovecraft’s argument for the novelty of a truly pessimistic perspective also applies to the general pursuit of ideas: all of human thought and activity is tilted towards goodness—towards pleasure, happiness, flourishing, sunshine, rainbows, kittens; we rarely, if ever, gaze into the abyss in a sustained and systematic manner—the black forests and swamps of idea-land are under-explored. We sometimes stumble upon detrimental ideas in the happy valleys and sunny meadows, so it would stand to reason that we might also stumble upon the most wondrous and beneficent ideas while exploring darker terrain; if “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions\">the road to hell is paved with good intentions</a>”, then <em>ipso facto</em> the road to heaven is paved with bad intentions.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp\" width=\"1456\" height=\"967\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":967,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":317908,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca00b53-20f3-4915-8749-ce0185dce1da_3072x2040.webp 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, please consider supporting us with a <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/seeds_science\">one-time donation</a> or a paid subscription.

review</a> of Joe Henrich’s <em>The Secret of our Success:</em></p><blockquote><p>In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multi-day processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten.</p><p>Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever, seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, stomach troubles, and vomiting).</p><p>So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.</p><p>Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.</p></blockquote><p>He continues:</p><blockquote><p>Humans evolved to transmit culture with high fidelity. And one of the biggest threats to transmitting culture with high fidelity was Reason. Our ancestors lived in <strong>epistemic hell</strong>, where they had to constantly rely on causally opaque processes with justifications that couldn’t possibly be true, and if they ever questioned them then they might die. Historically, Reason has been the villain of the human narrative, a corrosive force that tempts people away from adaptive behavior towards choices that “sounded good at the time”.</p></blockquote><h3>II.</h3><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

You Need to be Prepared for That</a>”, SlimeMoldTimeMold discuss an example of a particular epistemic hell that we managed to escape from through sheer dumb luck. SMTM review Maciej Cegłowski’s essay <em><a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm\">Scott And Scurvy</a> </em>which tells the incredible true history of how we came to understand the titular disease. They (SMTM is two people) say that it is one of the most interesting things they’ve ever read and that they can’t do full justice to all the twists and turns of the story; I will try to briefly summarize their telling of the story so you should expect even less justice to be done to it, but here it goes anyways.</p><p>First, how terrible was scurvy?</p><blockquote><p>Scurvy killed more than two million sailors between the time of Columbus’s transatlantic voyage and the rise of steam engines in the mid-19th century. The problem was so common that shipowners and governments assumed a 50% death rate from scurvy for their sailors on any major voyage. According to historian Stephen Bown scurvy was responsible for more deaths at sea than storms, shipwrecks, combat, and all other diseases combined. In fact, scurvy was so devastating that the search for a cure became what Bown describes as “a vital factor determining the destiny of nations.”</p><p>None of the potential fates awaiting sailors was pleasant, but scurvy exacted a particularly gruesome death. The earliest symptom—lethargy so intense that people once believed laziness was a cause of the disease—is debilitating. Your body feels weak. Your joints ache. Your arms and legs swell, and your skin bruises at the slightest touch. As the disease progresses, your gums become spongy and your breath fetid, your teeth loosen, and internal hemorrhaging makes splotches on your skin. Old wounds open; mucous membranes bleed. Left untreated, you will die, likely from a sudden hemorrhage near your heart or brain. (<strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/the-age-of-scurvy\">The Age of Scurvy</a><strong>”)</strong></p></blockquote><p>Hellish indeed, but<strong> </strong>the real (epistemic) horror of this story comes from the fact that a simple cure for a terrible disease—eat literally anything with vitamin C in it, which is basically all foods except muscle meat, bread, eggs, and cheese—was repeatedly lost.</p><blockquote><p>Scurvy was “cured” as early as 1497, when Vasco de Gama's crew discovered the power of citrus... but this cure was repeatedly lost, forgotten, rediscovered, misconstrued, confused, and just generally messed around with for <em>hundreds of years</em>, despite being a leading killer of seafarers and other explorers. By the 1870s the \"citrus cure\" was discredited, and for nearly sixty years, scurvy— <em>despite being cured, with scientific research to back it up</em>—continued killing people, including men on Scott's 1911 expedition to the South Pole. This went on until vitamin C was finally isolated in 1932 during research on guinea pigs.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy#19th_century\">Wikipedia page</a> does a good job of summarizing the history of cures; many people in the 1500s and 1600s knew that citrus fruits did the trick. The story you may have learned about in school was that of Scottish physician James Lind who supposedly found the cure for scurvy when he ran one of the first controlled experiments in medical history. The problem is that while yes, Lind did do an experiment which provided evidence that lemons could cure scurvy, he didn’t even recognize the significance of his own findings. In case you weren’t sure whether or not we should credit Lind with discovering the cure, there is an article in the Lancet titled, “<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)17588-0/fulltext#:~:text=Lind%20recommends%20lemon%20juice%20only,be%20replaced%20by%20an%20infusion.\">Treatment for scurvy not discovered by Lind</a>”.</p><blockquote><p>Throughout the 400-year history of scurvy, James Lind is systematically introduced as the man who discovered and promoted lemon juice as the best way to treat the condition. However, lemon juice was not distributed to English sailors until 40 years after the publication of his dissertation. Some say his findings did not convince the Admiralty. I wonder whether Lind himself was unconvinced.</p><p>In 1747, Lind did a trial on 12 sailors, the results of which showed the effectiveness of a mix of lemon and orange juices against scurvy. However, the experiment occupies only four out of 400 pages of his treatise on scurvy, in several chapters of which he disregards the observations. Scurvy, Lind writes, is provoked mainly by dampness. Adding, in the chapter on prevention, that those affected need dry air. Lind recommends lemon juice only to fight the effects of the dampness inevitable at sea. Furthermore, the chapter on treatment hardly mentions citrus fruit, and instead focuses on exercise and change of air. Lemons are mentioned, but Lind adds that they can be replaced by an infusion.</p></blockquote><p>So it wasn’t Lind, but eventually the British Royal Navy did figure out the citrus cure, basically just by accidentally noticing that sailors didn’t get scurvy when they ate lemons on long voyages. SlimeMoldTimeMold describe the comedy of errors that then led to the Royal Navy discrediting the citrus cure.</p><blockquote><p>Originally, the Royal Navy was given lemon juice, which works well because it contains a lot of vitamin C. But at some point between 1799 and 1870, someone switched out lemons for limes, which contain a lot less vitamin C. Worse, the lime juice was pumped through copper tubing as part of its processing, which destroyed the little vitamin C that it had to begin with.</p><p>This ended up being fine, because ships were so much faster at this point that no one had time to develop scurvy. So everything was all right until 1875, when a British arctic expedition set out on an attempt to reach the North Pole. They had plenty of lime juice and thought they were prepared — but they all got scurvy.</p><p>The same thing happened a few more times on other polar voyages, and this was enough to convince everyone that citrus juice doesn’t cure scurvy. The bacterial theory of disease was the hot new thing at the time, so from the 1870s on, people played around with a theory that a bacteria-produced substance called “ptomaine” in preserved meat was the cause of scurvy instead.</p><p>This theory was wrong, so it didn’t work very well.</p></blockquote><p>The road to rediscovering the citrus cure began with a stroke of dumb luck:</p><blockquote><p>It was pure luck that led to the actual discovery of vitamin C. Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich had been studying beriberi (another deficiency disease) in pigeons, and when they decided to switch to a mammal model, they serendipitously chose guinea pigs, the one animal besides human beings and monkeys that requires vitamin C in its diet. Fed a diet of pure grain, the animals showed no signs of beriberi, but quickly sickened and died of something that closely resembled human scurvy.</p><p>No one had seen scurvy in animals before. With a simple animal model for the disease in hand, it became a matter of running the correct experiments, and it was quickly established that scurvy was a deficiency disease after all. Very quickly the compound that prevents the disease was identified as a small molecule present in cabbage, lemon juice, and many other foods, and in 1932 Szent-Györgyi definitively isolated ascorbic acid.</p></blockquote><p>This dramatically undersells how hellish the whole situation was.</p><blockquote><p>Holst and Frolich also ran a version of the study with dogs. But the dogs were fine. They never developed scurvy, because unlike humans and guinea pigs, they don’t need vitamin C in their diet. Almost any other animal would also have been fine — guinea pigs and a few species of primates just happen to be really weird about vitamin C. So what would this have looked like if Holst and Frolich just never got around to replicating their dog research on guinea pigs? What if the guinea pigs had gotten lost in the mail?</p></blockquote><p>SlimeMoldTimeMold describe how devilishly bewildering the whole situation would have been if the guinea pigs had in fact gotten lost in the mail by imagining a hypothetical dialogue between the two researchers.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> You know Holst, I think old James Lind was right. I think scurvy really is a disease of deficiency, that there’s something in citrus fruits and cabbages that the human body needs, and that you can’t go too long without.</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> Frolich, what are you talking about? That doesn’t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> No, I think it makes very good sense. People who have scurvy and eat citrus, or potatoes, or many other foods, are always cured.</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> Look, we know that can’t be right. George Nares had plenty of lime juice when he led his expedition to the North Pole, but they all got scurvy in a couple weeks. The same thing happened in the Expedition to Franz-Josef Land in 1894. They had high-quality lime juice, everyone took their doses, but everyone got scurvy. It can’t be citrus.</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> Maybe some citrus fruits contain the antiscorbutic [scurvy-curing] property and others don’t. Maybe the British Royal Navy used one kind of lime back when Lind did his research but gave a different kind of lime to Nares and the others on their Arctic expeditions. Or maybe they did something to the lime juice that removed the antiscorbutic property. Maybe they boiled it, or ran it through copper piping or something, and that ruined it.</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> Two different kinds of limes? Frolich, you gotta get a hold of yourself. Besides, the polar explorers found that fresh meat also cures scurvy. They would kill a polar bear or some seals, have the meat for dinner, and then they would be fine. You expect me to believe that this antiscorbutic property is found in both polar bear meat AND some kinds of citrus fruits, but not in other kinds of citrus?</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> You have to agree that it’s possible. Why can’t the property be in some foods and not others?</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> It’s possible, but it seems really unlikely. Different varieties of limes are way more similar to one another than they are to polar bear meat. I guess what you describe fits the evidence, but it really sounds like you made it up just to save your favorite theory.</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> Look, it’s still consistent with what we know. It would also explain why Lind says that citrus cures scurvy, even though it clearly didn’t cure scurvy in the polar expeditions. All you need is different kinds of citrus, or something in the preparation that ruined it — or both!</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> What about our research? We fed those dogs nothing but grain for weeks. They didn’t like it, but they didn’t get scurvy. We know that grain isn’t enough to keep sailors from getting scurvy, so if scurvy is about not getting enough of something in your diet, those dogs should have gotten scurvy too.</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> Maybe only a few kinds of animals need the antiscorbutic property in their food. Maybe humans need it, but dogs don’t. I bet if those guinea pigs hadn’t gotten lost in the mail, and we had run our study on guinea pigs instead of dogs, the guinea pigs would have developed scurvy.</p><p><strong>Holst:</strong> Let me get this straight, you think there’s this magical ingredient, totally essential to human life, but other animals don’t need it at all? That we would have seen something entirely different if we had used guinea pigs or rats or squirrels or bats or beavers?</p><p><strong>Frolich:</strong> Yeah basically. I bet most animals don’t need this “ingredient”, but humans do, and maybe a few others. So we won’t see scurvy in our studies unless we happen to choose the right animal, and we just picked the wrong animal when we decided to study dogs. If we had gotten those guinea pigs, things would have turned out different.</p><p>[cute scene]</p><p>…and Frolich is entirely right on every point. He also sounds totally insane.</p><p>Maybe there are different kinds of citrus. Maybe some animals need this mystery ingredient and others don’t. Maybe polar bear meat is, medically speaking, more like citrus fruit from Sicily than like citrus fruit from the West Indies. <em>Really???</em></p></blockquote><h3>III.</h3><p>One more example of an epistemic hell—from Gwern’s (fantastic) essay<br>“<a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/reviews/Bakewell#\">The Origins of Innovation: Bakewell & Breeding</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>People, both ordinary and men of leisure, often intensely interested in agriculture, have been farming animals for millennia and presumably interfering in their reproduction, and had ample opportunity to informally observe many matings, long pedigrees, crosses between breeds, and comparisons with neighboring farmers, and they had great incentive to reach correct beliefs not just for the immediate & compounding returns but also from being able to sell their superior specimens for improving other herds. But with all of this incentive, we were horribly confused on even the most basic principles of heredity for millennia…</p></blockquote><div class=\"pullquote\"><p>“It took humanity a remarkably long time to discover that there are consistent relations between parent and offspring, and to develop ways of studying those relations. The raw phenomena of heredity were sufficiently complex to be impervious to ‘common-sense’ reasoning, to the brilliant but stifling schemas that were developed by the Greek philosophers, and even to the stunning forays of the early scientists.” (“Heredity before Genetics: a History”; Cobb, 2006)</p></div><blockquote><p>We now know that here are an indefinitely long list of ways that development can go wrong with thousands of environmental insults or developmental error or distinct genetic diseases (each with many possible contributing mutations), and that for the most part, each case is its own special case; sometimes ‘monsters’ can shed light on key aspects of biology like metabolic pathways, but that requires biology centuries more advanced than was available, and that the search for universal principles was futile. There <em>are</em> universal principles but they pertain mostly to populations, must be investigated in the aggregate, statistically, and individual counterexamples can only be shrugged at, as the universal principles can be and often are overridden by many of those special cases.</p></blockquote><p>So how did we escape?</p><blockquote><p>What was required was not a novel piece of apparatus, nor even a new theory; the key thing that was needed was statistically extraordinary data sets. On the one hand, these were composed of many reliable human pedigrees of unusual or pathological characters; on the other, they were the large-scale experimental studies that were carried out consciously by Mendel, or as a by-product of the commercial activity of eighteenth-century livestock breeders.</p></blockquote><h3>IV.</h3><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg\" width=\"587\" height=\"675.05\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":920,\"width\":800,\"resizeWidth\":587,\"bytes\":189314,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3c4919-df13-421d-a23d-650c46764433_800x920.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h4>So what exactly is an epistemic hell?</h4><p>Although these three examples differ in numerous significant ways, they all speak to a treacherousness wherein the dictates of logic and “proper” scientific investigation can led you further away from the truth. On some level, an epistemic hell is simply a case of bad luck—the world happens to be set up in a way where appearances, common sense, and obvious experiments/interventions are misleading in regards to some phenomenon. If we were utterly lost and had no idea where to even begin that would be one thing; the real problem, however, is that it doesn’t feel very hellish when you’re in the midst of a scientific inferno—it may seem like there are numerous promising hypotheses on offer, or that the phenomena in question is simply not amenable to any straightforward theory/remedy. There may even be optimism that now, finally, we are on the right track, and a breakthrough is right around the corner if we just keep plugging away.</p><h4>What current scientific unknowns may be devilishly difficult in ways we don’t comprehend?</h4><p>Complex diseases/disorders on which little progress has been made seem like good candidates; from the aforementioned “<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm\">Scott and Scurvy</a>” essay:</p><blockquote><p>…one of the simplest of diseases managed to utterly confound us for so long, at the cost of millions of lives, even after we had stumbled across an unequivocal cure. It makes you wonder how many incurable ailments of the modern world—depression, autism, hypertension, obesity—will turn out to have equally simple solutions, once we are able to see them in the correct light. What will we be slapping our foreheads about sixty years from now, wondering how we missed something so obvious?</p></blockquote><p>It might seem like the diseases listed in the quote (I would add Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia to the list) are unlikely nominees, but of course that’s what it feels like when you are lost in the hell-sauce.</p><p>What about physics and cosmology?

It has some weak interaction, and that's pretty much it.’ <em>But I think there is a very good chance that we are missing some very important ingredients that a brilliant person might recognize in the coming years.</em>” Loeb even said the potential for a revolutionary physics breakthrough today “is not smaller — it's actually bigger right now” than it was in Einstein's time.</p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg\" width=\"667\" height=\"444.6666666666667\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":500,\"width\":750,\"resizeWidth\":667,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Picture 2\",\"title\":\"Picture 2\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Picture 2\" title=\"Picture 2\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49dd27c8-b7d9-423c-990c-7421e923fa8b_750x500.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And then there is the so-called Hard Problem of Consciousness, a prime candidate if there ever was one.

Liberation comes through paradigm shifts, quantum leaps to entirely new regions of idea-space.</p><p>In the case of scurvy, it was dumb luck (the testing of guinea pigs) that saved us. This suggests that “serendipity engineering”, i.e. attempting to increase the randomness/entropy of the scientific process in a (somewhat) targeted manner, may be a generally helpful strategy (see “<a href=\"https://www.secretorum.life/p/randomness-in-science-edit\">Randomness in Science</a>” for further discussion).</p><p>For heredity, it was the assembly of “extraordinary datasets” (multi-generation pedigrees, large-scale breeding experiments) that allowed us to find a path out of the (disco) inferno. This is perhaps the most tried-and-true method we have for extricating ourselves from epistemic hells.</p><blockquote><p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The underlying cause of this disease is not known, but Epstein-Barr virus is thought to be a possible culprit. However, most people infected with this common virus do not develop multiple sclerosis, and it is not feasible to directly demonstrate causation of this disease in humans. <strong>Using data from millions of US military recruits monitored over a 20-year period</strong>, Bjornevik <em>et al</em>. determined that Epstein-Barr virus infection greatly increased the risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis and that it preceded the development of disease, supporting its potential role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (Bjornevik et al., 2022)</p></blockquote><p>Mendel had an extraordinary dataset (for his day), but the simplicity of his approach was also exceptional—he disregarded all prior thinking, much of which seemed quite reasonable, and started from first principles, reasoning only from self-collected data (there was also dumb luck—pea plants and the simple traits he studied happened to be unusually good for the observation of hereditary patterns). It makes sense that this would be helpful; part of being epistemically damned means that you don’t know what you think you know, so a kind of “unlearning” is needed (I discuss this at length in <a href=\"https://www.secretorum.life/p/life-on-the-grid-part-2\">Life on the Grid: Terra Incognita</a>, which is essentially a manifesto for how to make quantum leaps through idea-space)</p><blockquote><p>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. (Clarke’s first law)</p></blockquote><p>In the next post of this series (if you want to call it that), I’ll explore an approach for escaping epistemic hells which could be summarized as: <em>If you are going through hell, keep going.</em></p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, please consider supporting us with a <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/seeds_science\">one-time donation</a> or a paid subscription.

It's called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/People-Sing-Music-Human-Evolution/dp/9941401861\">Why Do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution</a></em> by Joseph Jordania.</p><p>If the title hasn't already piqued your interest, its thesis surely will. The thesis is wild, bold, and original, but makes an eerie amount of sense. If true, it would be a revolution — and I don't use the term lightly — in how we understand the evolution of music, cooperation, warfare, and even religion.</p><p>I have my reservations about Jordania's theory (and his book), but I'll save them for a later time. As Daniel Dennett once wrote about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)\">another remarkable theory</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think first it is very important to understand [the] project, to see a little bit more about what the whole shape of it is, and delay the barrage of nitpicking objections and criticisms until we have seen what the edifice as a whole is. After all, on the face of it, [the project] is preposterous... [but] I take it very seriously.</p></blockquote><p>These are exactly my feelings about Jordania's project. Seemingly preposterous, but worth taking very seriously.</p><h3>0. Stylized facts</h3><p>I'm going to share Jordania's theory with you, but first I want to present a set of \"stylized facts\" — curious, disparate, and nearly inexplicable phenomena that would seem to have little relation to each other. Then I'll present the theory that (uncannily) links them all together and explains everything.</p><p>OK, brace yourself. Here come the facts:</p><ul><li><p>When our ancestors<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> first moved from the forest to the savannah, we were not yet capable of making tools. But early hominid evolution tended <em>away</em> from a physiology that would have helped us hunt and/or defend ourselves from predators. Our canine teeth receded, we became slower and weaker, and we didn't develop tough skin (in fact the opposite).</p></li><li><p>Lion evolution and migration seems to have mirrored early hominid patterns, both spatiotemporally and (in some ways) behaviorally and morphologically. Lions, for example, are the only <em>social</em> species of cat.</p></li><li><p>Humans are the only ground-dwelling species that sings. There are over 4000 singing species — mostly birds, but also gibbons, dolphins, whales, and seals. But they all sing from water or the trees. When a bird lands on the ground, it invariably stops singing.</p></li><li><p>Of all singing creatures, humans are the only ones who use rhythm.</p></li><li><p>When we sing, we almost always dance, even if it's just nodding along or tapping a foot. Both singing and dancing (whether together or separate) are group activities used across the world in tribal bonding rituals. Isolated ethnic groups have remarkably similar styles of song and dance.</p></li><li><p>Rhythmic chanting and dancing induce trance states.</p></li><li><p>Early hominids quite possibly ate their dead, and (some while later) definitely started burying them. The instinct to preserve a dead human body from mutilation, and then to dispose of it, is fairly universal. E.g. we strive to retrieve corpses even from a battlefield.</p></li></ul><p>I hope you are intrigued. Each of these facts is hard to explain even in isolation. So a theory that can unify and account for all of them will have to be either profound or crazy — or both.<br><br>At this point I'm going to present Jordania's theory as clearly and comprehensively as I can. I'll interpolate a bit and add my own explanatory flare, but the ideas come straight out of his book.</p><h3>1. Hunters or Scavengers?</h3><p>When human ancestors first descended from the trees and stepped out onto the grasslands, they faced two critical problems: acquiring food and defending themselves from predators. We'll discuss food acquisition in this section and defense in the next section, but as you'll see they're linked by a similar mechanism.</p><p>I hadn't thought deeply about these problems until I read Jordania's book. I always imagined, naively, that early humans had been \"hunter-gatherers.\" While this is true of later humans, it's almost certainly not true of our earliest savannah-dwelling ancestors. Gathering? yes. But hunting, especially big-game hunting, was out of the question. As I mentioned, our earliest ancestors hadn't yet learned how to make or use tools beyond simple rocks and sticks, and we were fairly weak.</p><p>Yet we certainly ate meat — the archaeological record is pretty clear on that. So there's a growing consensus that we were actually scavengers (or perhaps \"scavenger-gatherers\").</p><p>Now there are two types of scavenging, two strategies for \"carcass acquisition\": passive and confrontational. <strong>Passive scavenging</strong> occurs when the scavenger comes across an undefended carcass. If the carcass was the result of a natural (non-predatory) death, there will be plenty to eat, assuming the scavenger finds it it before putrefaction sets in (about 48 hours). But even if the carcass was killed and eaten by a predator, there's going to be some meat left on the bone. And, just as important, <em>inside</em> the bone. Marrow was an excellent source of calories for our early ancestors, and we were in a unique position to access it, since we could use rocks as primitive tools to break the bones open. The archeological record shows bones that were repeatedly smashed with \"hammering stones,\" as well as bones that had scrape-marks, indicating that we also used sharp stones to carve off some of the clingier meat.</p><p>Now, <strong>confrontational scavenging</strong> is where it gets interesting — and also more circumstantial. Confrontational scavenging, also known as <em>power</em> or <em>aggressive</em> scavenging, happens when an animal (or group of animals) comes across a carcass that's in the process of being eaten, whether by the original predator or another scavenger. In this case, a confrontation ensues, and to the victor go the spoils.</p><p>Whether our ancestors practiced confrontational scavenging is hard to determine, given the evidence available to us at this point, but it's not a crazy idea. It happens all the time in the (non-human) animal kingdom, as when a pack of hyenas scares a lion away from its kill.</p><h3>2. Defense from Predators</h3><p>Along with finding food, defense from predators is crucial to the survival of any species, and ours presents a puzzle.</p><p>We definitely had predators — lions, principally, but also other big cats (jaguars, leopards), as well as hyenas and maybe crocodiles. (Or more accurately, the <em>ancestors</em> of those species, since they've been evolving just as we have. Hyena-ancestors, for example, were much larger than their modern descendants.)</p><p>Physically, early humans were quite weak — <em>and getting weaker with each generation</em>. As I mentioned earlier, our canines were receding and our skin was growing softer. And we were getting bigger, it's true, but not stronger. Our size developed in service of bipedalism, which made us both weaker and slower(!). A chimpanzee, for instance, is roughly <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2009/02/how_strong_is_a_chimpanzee.html\">twice as strong</a> as a modern human, and can run just as fast if not faster. In the general case, bipedalism results in slower sprinting speeds, even if it increases efficiency (allowing us to walk/run for longer stretches).</p><p>Across the animal kingdom there are various strategies for evading or defending against predators, known in the literature as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipredator_adaptation\">antipredator adaptations</a>. Each adaptation defends against one of the four stages of predation: detection, attack, capture, and consumption. To evade detection, for example, most species pursue a strategy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis\">crypsis</a>, aka hiding. To evade capture, species rely on speed, burrowing, climbing into trees, etc. And to evade consumption, species develop physical defenses like claws, fangs, horns, shells (or at least a tough hide), venom, etc.</p><p>But early humans weren't doing any of these things. Physiologically, we weren't getting stronger or faster, or developing sharper claws or teeth or tougher skin. Nor were we trying to hide. Habitual bipedalism has its benefits, but going unnoticed in the grass certainly isn't one of them.</p><p>In fact, we seem to have evolved to become <em>more</em> noticeable, <em>more</em> conspicuous. We grew taller, we sang and made noise (the only animal who sings from the ground), we painted our bodies, and we developed strong body odor.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>The strategy of being conspicuous is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism\">aposematism</a>: <em>apo</em> (away from) + <em>sematism</em> (signalling) = counter-signalling. Aposematism is an antipredator adaptation which prevents an attack from happening in the first place, by making it easier for the predator to recognize you as <em>unprofitable</em>.</p><p>Species who counter-signal (aposematically) abound in nature, but they all have something up their sleeves, so to speak. Being conspicuous is a viable strategy only when you're advertising an otherwise invisible weapon. Consider the following aposematic species from across the animal kingdom:</p><ul><li><p>skunks and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_Polecat\">zorillas</a></p></li><li><p>bees, wasps, hornets, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_ant\">velvet ants</a></p></li><li><p>black widows and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redback_spider\">redback spiders</a></p></li><li><p>poison dart frogs and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_salamander\">fire salamanders</a></p></li><li><p>all manner of snakes, e.g. the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake\">coral snake</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasepia_pfefferi\">flamboyant cuttlefish</a></p></li></ul><p>Each of these species has a powerful defensive weapon — often some kind of venom/poison, but also noxious odors. And most species advertise this with distinctive coloration (bright and high-contrast), but some use other signals. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake\">Rattlesnakes</a> and bees use sound, for example, and many species, including zorillas, 'mark their territory' using scents.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><p>Aposematism (being conspicuous) doesn't help an organism in a single encounter with a predator; in fact it's a liability. But it helps with repeated encounters. When a predator gets sprayed by a skunk or stung by a bee, it quickly learns to avoid future encounters with all members of the species.</p><p>All of this raises a most important question: <em>how did early humans manage to get away with aposematism? What defensive weapons did we have up our sleeves?</em></p><p>The answer probably won't surprise you: we used stones. It's how we used them (section 4) that's so unusual.</p><h3>3. Stones</h3><p>Stones were the most fundamental weapon at our disposal — the only means we had of causing actual physical damage to another animal.</p><p>When we first started living on the savannah, we hadn't yet developed the hand/eye coordination necessary to <em>hunt</em> with stones (or to make and use other tools for that purpose). But self-defense is a much simpler proposition, for a number of reasons.</p><p>First, using stones to hunt requires a lot of force and a lot of dexterity. You need to hit a target that's moving away from you at high speed, and gravity is not on your side. But defense is different. Defense happens up close. It's much easier to bash a lion with a large rock when the lion is coming toward you. And bringing the rock <em>down</em> allows gravity to work for you rather than against you.</p><p>Moreover, attack and defense are fundamentally asymmetrical. Like in a lawsuit, where the prosecution assumes the burden of proof, in a hunt the predator assumes the burden of actually killing its prey. But to succeed at defense, you don't need to kill your would-be predator — you only need to injure it. If a lion or other competitor gets injured while attacking a human, it will flee the scene, opting to lose a meal rather than risk its life by continuing to fight.</p><p>And finally, defense was easier for early humans because we helped each other. In most of these circumstances (while being attacked and during confrontational scavenging raids), we had group members by our sides, ready to throw their own stones if others in the group became incapacitated.</p><p>Cooperation was indeed our biggest advantage, and our early ancestors refined it, quite literally, to a high art.</p><h3>4. Audio-Visual Intimidation Display</h3><p><strong>Here, finally, is the crux of Jordania's thesis</strong>. His claim is that early humans developed a unique defense he calls the Audio-Visual Intimidation Display:</p><blockquote><p>My suggestion is that our ancestors turned loud singing into a central element of their defence system against predators. They started using loud, rhythmic singing and shouting accompanied by vigorous, threatening body movements and object throwing to defend themselves from predators.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p></blockquote><p>Before we go any further, I'd like you to see the AVID in action. Amazingly, some 'primitive' ethnic groups have maintained an AVID-like tradition into modern times. The <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailao\">kailao</a></em> war dance of the Wallisian people and the Samoan <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cibi\">cibi</a></em> are two examples, but the best-documented tradition is the <em>haka</em> of the New Zealand Māori.</p><p>Wikipedia describes the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka\">haka</a></em> as</p><blockquote><p>a traditional ancestral war cry, dance or challenge from the Māori people of New Zealand. It is a posture dance performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment....</p><p>Various actions are employed in the course of a performance, including facial contortions such as showing the whites of the eyes and the poking out of the tongue, and a wide variety of vigorous body actions such as slapping the hands against the body and stamping of the feet. As well as chanted words, a variety of cries and grunts are used.</p></blockquote><p>For a demonstration we now turn to YouTube. Here's a video of a <em>haka</em> by the New Zealand army, showing just how visually and auditorily intimidating it could be:</p><p>And here's a more traditional version:</p><p>The point of the AVID (of which the <em>haka</em> is the best-known example) is:</p><ul><li><p><strong>To intimidate competitors with loud sounds</strong>. Shouting in unison is clearly the best way to do this, because the result is far louder than any sound an individual human can make. But clapping, slapping, stomping, and <em>banging rocks together</em> would have added nicely to the cacophony.</p></li><li><p><strong>To intimidate competitors visually</strong>. The synchronized movements, body paint, and bizarre gestures (including facial expressions) would confuse and intimidate even the fiercest competitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>To project the image of a single, powerful organism</strong>. As Jordania puts it, \"rhythmically well-organized group vocalizations [and movements] send a strong message to the predator about the unity and determination of the group.\" Although the group is composed of individual humans, during an AVID the group acts as if it were a single, multiheaded, many-armed creature. In some ways it's a fiction, but as far as the competitor is concerned, if the movements and actions are sufficiently coordinated, the group becomes a unitary beast for all intents and purposes.</p></li></ul><p>Remember, the AVID would have been used for confrontational scavenging as well as defense against predators — and would have included rocks as physical weapons to fall back on when the intimidation display wasn't perfectly effective as a non-contact defense.</p><h3>5. Battle Trance</h3><p>Jordania also suggests that humans evolved a specific state of consciousness — the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_trance\">battle trance</a></em> — to go along with the Audio-Visual Intimidation Display. This state has several characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>Analgesia and aphobia — no pain and no fear.</p></li><li><p>Neglect of individual survival instincts.</p></li><li><p>Loss of individual identity and acquisition of a collective identity.</p></li></ul><p>Central to the battle trance is the notion of <em>collective</em> or <em>group identity</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Like in a well-established combat unit, where in the heat of the battle one can sacrifice his own life to save a friend's life, human ancestors developed the feel of <em>group identity</em>. The feel of group identity is based on the total trust and dedication of each member of the group to the common interest. Group identity kicks in when there is a critical situation, a mortal danger for survival of the group or any of its members. In such moments, the noble principle of 'One for all, all for one' rules any individual self-preserving instinct, fear and pain.</p></blockquote><p>This state of consciousness may have originally evolved for parents (especially mothers) to defend their children when threatened, but it was repurposed for group defense and confrontational scavenging. And in the process, we developed a new trigger for it: rhythmic chanting and synchronized body movements.</p><blockquote><p>Evolution supplied powerful neurological mechanisms to make this feeling a positive experience. Going into group identity brings the most exhilarating feelings to every member of the group. Every member of the group feels bigger, feel stronger, and virtually feels immortal.... Group members in such an altered state of mind, when they share total trust with each other, emotionally believe that the group cannot be defeated. This unique altered state of mind is supported (and most likely caused) by the powerful neurological substances such as endorphins and oxytocin, which are momentarily released in the brain when a critical survival situations arises. As the neurological substances are released into the brain, feelings of pain and fear are blocked, and total trust and exhilaration of being part of a supernaturally strong unit becomes overwhelming.</p></blockquote><p>Actual combat isn't as central to our lives in the 21st century, but the battle trance and feelings of collective identity still echo in many of our <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/modern-rituals-of-solidarity/\">modern rituals of solidarity</a>, which I wrote about last year, and they're particularly pronounced in <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/religion-politics-and-self-suppression/\">religion/politics</a> and <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/sports-are-rituals-of-solidarity/\">team/spectator sports</a>.</p><h3>6. Cannibalism (and burial) of the dead</h3><p>As if Jordania's theory didn't cover enough ground already, he has one last surprise in store for us. He claims that early humans practiced cannibalism of their dead as a key part of their comprehensive antipredator strategy.</p><p>If you recall from section 2, the goal of aposematism is to advertise that, as a piece of prey, you are decidedly unprofitable for the predator. If a predator can easily recognize you (and other members of your species), and remembers getting burned during past encounters, it will quickly learn to stop attacking you in the first place.</p><p>Given this strategy, it's very important not to let the lions (or any other predator) get away with killing and eating a human. The more our ancestors were able to reinforce the message that <em>humans are not a (good) meal</em>, the safer they would be across repeated encounters. This was especially important for early humans because, unlike an actually poisonous species, human meat <em>is</em> worth eating, if a predator can get away with it.</p><p>This implies a heavy selection pressure for the following behaviors among our ancestors:</p><ul><li><p>If a predator attacks during a confrontation, <em>make sure it gets injured</em>.</p></li><li><p>If a predator manages to kill one of your fellow humans, <em>don't let it eat</em>. Retrieve the body of your fallen comrade or your whole tribe will be in danger.</p></li><li><p>When a human dies naturally, <em>make sure the corpse is properly disposed of</em>. The corpse is a liability because a predator will associate even a scavenged meal (of human meat) with 'profitability'.</p></li></ul><p>None of this implies that our ancestors had to practice <em>cannibalism</em> of their dead. Any means of keeping human meat out of the mouths of predators would have been effective. But there's some evidence that suggests cannibalism (stone scrapings on human bones similar to the scrapings on the bones of other animals), and if calories were hard to come by, it might have been an ecological necessity.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There's so much more to say about this theory, but I'll save most of it for another time.</p><p>I'd just like to end by showing how some our beliefs and behaviors take on new significance in light of Jordania's theory, especially those that relate to how we handle the bodies of our dead.</p><p>Funerary traditions vary widely around the world, but all have one thing in common: disposal of the body. Mechanisms include burial, entombment, mummification, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_at_sea\">burial at sea</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_burial\">sky burial</a><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>, and ritual cannibalism, and even more exotic mechanisms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_coffins\">hanging coffins</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_tree\">tree burial</a>. The common reasons given for disposal practices are all public-health-related, but intentional burial is <a href=\"http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba66/feat1.shtml\">at least 225,000 years old</a>. Of course our ancestors wouldn't want a corpse rotting in their camp, but there's quite a leap from disposal to burial. Why not just drag the corpse away from camp and expose it to the elements?</p><p>Jordania's theory doesn't predict <em>how</em> exactly we should dispose of our dead, but it predicts that we should care an awful lot about it (i.e. that it should be something <em>sacred</em>), and that we should be especially concerned that the body doesn't fall into the wrong hands. In Paleolithic times, this ensured that our ancestors retrieved the bodies of their comrades when they were killed by predators. But you can see vestiges of this in historic times — e.g. in our concern for salvaging bodies of the war dead. Mutilating or otherwise desecrating the war dead is <a href=\"http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/01/ap-marine-afghanistan-desecration-war-dead-goes-back-centuries-011312/\">an ancient practice</a>, a ghastly way for the victor to show utter dominance over the loser.</p><p>And finally, Jordania's theory helps explain the the <em>religious</em> nature of our funerary practices. Burial has always been a quintessentially religious practice. For example, we date the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_religion\">earliest religious behavior</a> in our ancestors by when they started burying their dead. But religions are fundamentally about the living — a set of beliefs and practices that relate to collective identity and tribal cohesion.</p><p>Why do religions care about the disposal of corpses? This has always puzzled me. It's always seemed like such a mundane concern. When someone dies, that should be the end of what we care about, and removing the body should be no more sacred than taking out the trash. Chimpanzees, for instance, can perceive when another chimp passes away (and mourn), but they <a href=\"http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba66/feat1.shtml\">soon lose interest</a> in the body.</p><p>But if Jordania is right, it's no coincidence that death rituals are intimately bound up with collective identity, because they're two parts of the same system.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, please consider supporting us with a <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/seeds_science\">one-time donation</a> or a paid subscription.

When we can’t agree on this most fundamental distinction, we're not talking about the same thing.</p><p>I’ve been mulling over the idea of beauty recently, letting the word glide around over many possible meanings. It took a while, but I finally found one that clicked. Unlike the other meanings I’ve toyed with, this one is tangible and solid; it keeps its shape. I’ve had a lot of fun playing around with it, and I’m going to share it with you today.</p><p>But please, understand that I’m not trying to <a href=\"https://everythingstudies.com/2018/02/12/wordy-weapons-of-is-ought-alloy/\">annex the word</a>, to repurpose it to point toward my preferred concept. I don’t particularly care what other people mean when they talk about “beauty”; I have no dog in that fight. I just want to describe something that happens in the world, something I think is fascinating. And the best label I can think to give it is “beauty.”</p><p>Are you with me?</p><p>Here’s a little preview of where we’re headed: I want to talk about beauty as a game. Specifically, a two-player game. Or to be maximally precise: <em>a family of games with two main player classes</em>.</p><p>It will make sense soon, I promise.</p><p>In the meantime, please leave your semantic baggage at home, put on your <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/nat-epis/\">Quinean naturalist’s</a> hat (ideally with a bright feather in it), and let’s head out on a little armchair safari.</p><h3>Desire</h3><p>As a way of approaching this thing we want to talk about — “beauty” — we’ll begin with a simpler phenomenon. Whenever a creature observes something, gets a good feeling, and is attracted to it, let’s call that <em>desire</em>.</p><p>The phenomenon of desire — attraction mediated by perception — describes many of the basic low-level instincts that animals have. So we can speak of the <em>desire</em> for food and the <em>desire</em> for sex, to give some paradigmatic examples. But we can also say that mother animals <em>desire</em> their children, and vice versa. Or that a squirrel, looking up at a nice perch, <em>desires</em> it as a place to rest.</p><p>For our purposes today, no special cognitive complexity or inner experience is required. Even a lowly insect can be the subject of desire — as a dragonfly toward its mate, for example, or a dung beetle toward a piece of dung.</p><p>It’s not hard to see how desires like these can be adaptive, i.e., the kinds of features sculpted by natural selection. We can even see this in our own species. Smooth skin is a sign of good health, whereas boiling skin is a sign of disease, and so we evolved to desire the former and be disgusted by the latter. A ripe strawberry is nutritious, whereas deer droppings are not, and desire helps us choose between them. One of these landscapes is better suited for humans — and which are you drawn toward?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"404\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":404,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6351b810-9f71-4b3b-a68a-7546856952d7_1860x516.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Not every desire is adaptive, of course; our sensibilities often lead us astray.

But often the player’s brain isn’t flexible enough, so the learning takes place in the species’ genome via natural selection; in that case, the player is actually the entire species. Either way, Desire eventually learns what to approach and what to avoid.</p><p>Now we could stop here and declare that <em>beauty = whatever triggers good feelings in a Desire player</em>. This would be a perfectly sensible definition: if something appeals to you, it’s beautiful, end of story. This is the kind of beauty that people say is “in the eye of the beholder,” where each creature develops its own subjective tastes. The dung beetle can find dung “beautiful” while we find it disgusting, and there's no tension whatever between these two facts.</p><p>This definition of beauty would make a fine concept — <em>if</em> we were diligent about hewing to it. It’s just that games of solitaire are boring, so the word we’re attempting to pin down keeps slipping off for more exciting meanings, for denotations with sexier connotations.</p><p>Specifically, it’s when a second player enters the field — a player who produces something <em>deliberately</em> to attract the Desire player — that things really start to heat up.</p><h3>Player Two</h3><p>By way of introducing the second player, consider this brief visual history of plant life on Earth. We’ll start with the earliest single-celled organisms and work our way down to plant species in the present day.</p><p>So, Earth is 4.5 billion years old.

But when we step back and take the long view, we can see that they’re a <em>dramatic departure</em> from previous forms of plant life. Where everything else is drab and boring, a flower is bold and showy. While other plant organs are strictly utilitarian, a flower goes out of its way to be noticed. It’s a bid for visual attention in a world that’s otherwise oblivious to the gaze of others.</p><p>This is player two, AKA the Beauty player:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

For fertilization, a plant needs to get its pollen (i.e., plant sperm) over to another plant of the same species. Before flowers, plants did this by releasing their pollen in water or on the wind, hoping it would land in the right place. But this is a scattershot approach, error-prone and exceptionally wasteful. The genius of flowering plants was figuring out how to move pollen precisely and reliably by recruiting <em>animals</em> as their couriers. These are our Desire players, and in the context of flowering plants, they’re called <em>pollinators</em>. The most iconic pollinator, of course, is the honeybee. But the role can be filled by many other insects (like butterflies), as well as birds (hummingbirds) and even mammals (bats).</p><p>This relationship is simple, but also profound. The plant lures the pollinator with the promise of food (e.g., nectar). And when a plant consistently delivers on its promise, the pollinator keeps coming back. Not just to the very same plant, but to other plant of the same species, thus ensuring an extremely high fertilization efficiency.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> And the flower mediates this relationship by acting as a <em>brand image</em>. Its distinctive shape and arresting colors are a mnemonic to remind pollinators of the plant’s good faith and credit. “Get your sweet nectar here!” the flower calls out, “And wherever else you see our trademarked signs!”</p><p>Thus the flower’s beauty isn’t capricious. It’s a solution to a very concrete problem.</p><p>And what a solution it turned out to be! Since bursting on the scene some 130 million years ago, flowering plants have completely taken over from their predecessors, such that they now dominate the landscape. It’s estimated that flowering plants make up 90 percent of all plant species and more than half of all biomass on Earth.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> That’s the power of beauty.</p><h3>A game for two players</h3><p>Here, then, is our game.

In both games, Desire’s goal is to learn which perceptual cues are good vs. bad. So as the bee buzzes around, it uses its aesthetic sense to decide where to land — and when it sees something that tickles its brain in the right way, it flies toward it. But the bee doesn’t particularly care that the flower was made by an adaptive Beauty player. If nectar started bubbling up from the ground, the bee would be just as happy, and would soon develop a preference for cracks and fissures rather than flowers.</p><p>The Beauty player, however, can’t play solitaire. The whole point of Beauty is to make something Desire wants, to trigger the <em>oooh</em>-circuits in Desire’s brain. Without Desire, there’d be no audience for Beauty’s performance, and no reason for it to make anything beautiful.</p><p>The metaphor of <em>lock and key</em> might be helpful here. Desire’s brain acts like a lock, and only certain perceptual cues will fit the lock and engage the attraction response. Beauty, then, has to produce something that works as a key:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\" width=\"1324\" height=\"390\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":390,\"width\":1324,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8bb5764-ab6a-4d29-bd6f-d5f3a071e2d6_1324x390.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But whereas a physical lock-and-key system is engineered all at once, Desire and Beauty coevolve slowly. Their dance goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>The Desire player starts by playing solitaire, and evolves perceptual preferences that help in its environment. For example, an insect might develop a slight attraction to round shapes and/or bright colors (for reasons that have nothing to do with flowers).</p></li><li><p>A nascent Beauty player then evolves a form to deliberately target those preferences — a key that fits Desire’s lock. At first the form will only work as a weak trigger, but over time Beauty will learn to make stronger and stronger stimuli, like brighter colors and more symmetrical petals.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile, as long as the Beauty player continues to reward the Desire player (e.g., by feeding it nectar), then Desire will develop an even stronger preference for the relevant stimuli. What was initially just a slight bias will become a fixation.</p></li><li><p>If this relationship is fruitful, other Beauty players will inevitably try to get in on the action. And thus each Beauty player will need to <em>outcompete</em> its rivals by producing something that works as an even stronger trigger to the Desire player.</p></li></ol><p>And so on. This positive feedback loop — Desire chasing Beauty in realtime and Beauty chasing Desire over evolutionary time — is what drives the production of beauty in every nook and cranny of the natural world:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\" width=\"1454\" height=\"946\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":946,\"width\":1454,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88ddf03-aa38-4a5a-85e2-d67e51b45b3f_1454x946.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Please note: This is not a Grand Unified Theory of beauty. There are many important questions not addressed by this framing — for example, questions about taste and class, or which forms of beauty are sublime vs. merely kitsch. The idea of beauty-as-game will happily endorse both a Rembrandt and a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=thomas+kinkade&num=20&source=lnms&tbm=isch\">Thomas Kinkade</a> as “beautiful” — and if that’s a problem, you’ll have to seek distinctions elsewhere. Instead, the perspective offered here will help answer questions like <em>Why does beauty grow?</em> and <em>Under what conditions is beauty stable?</em> Or even, <em>How will beauty behave on other planets?</em></p><p>It’s about, in Sarah Perry’s phrase, the <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/12/03/an-ecology-of-beauty-and-strong-drink/\">ecology of beauty</a>.</p><p>Of course, no two beauty games are identical. They’re played in different media and different environments, and the economic relationships between the players can differ wildly from game to game. But there’s enough in common across all games that they’re worth examining together; they constitute a family. And that’s what we’re here to study.</p><h3>Two-player beauty in animals</h3><p>Now when I mentioned flowers earlier, I may have given the impression that they were the first Beauty players on Earth. Actually they're just the first in the plant kingdom. Whereas <em>animals</em> have been playing Beauty with other animals for quite a bit longer — maybe 300 million years longer, give or take.</p><p>When animals play beauty with each other, they almost always do it in the context of <em>sexual selection</em>, that is, in the competition for mates. Sexual selection typically occurs in polygynous species, where the males compete for opportunities to mate with the females. This kind of competition doesn’t always produce beauty; often it results in raw male-on-male aggression. But in species where it’s harder for males to dominate the females — i.e., when females have more choice — males must compete to <em>attract</em> potential mates.

That’s what’s easy to show on a web page. But it leaves out all the songs, dances, smells, and other attributes and behaviors that can’t be rendered as JPEGs. These forms of beauty are just as important to animals and are equally shaped by sexual selection. And the process is similar: preexisting perceptual biases in the female (Desire) player become an evolutionary target for the male (Beauty) player. For instance, a slight preference for certain sounds in the female nightingale’s auditory cortex is what induces the male nightingale to evolve its famous songs.</p><p>The media may be different, but the mechanics are the same. Within a given generation, female Desire players chase male Beauty players. But across generations, male traits evolve to target female preferences.</p><h3>Human beauty games</h3><p>But what about us? Do we also play beauty as a kind of mating dance?</p><p>We are animals, after all. And so it’s not surprising that we can pattern-match some of our activities to sexual selection driven by female choice. But it seems just as often to go the other way around, where women compete as the Beauty players vis-à-vis male Desire.</p><p>Sexual selection does sometimes occur in a monogamous species (ours being more or less deserving of the label). In such cases, males and females play both roles, Desire and Beauty; each makes a display for the other to admire and choose. Hence the ornaments <em>and</em> the eye for ornament among both sexes in the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/15/3/380/217125\">black swan</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/362238a0\">crested auklet</a>. And perhaps in our species as well.</p><p>But try as we might to pin a mating agenda on all human beauty production, it doesn’t always fit. Heterosexual men enjoy beautiful things made by other men, just as women enjoy performing for other women.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> Even very young children have an aesthetic sense.

Other forms include songs, dances, poetry, novels, and pretty much any other thing that’s considered an art form. A few forms that are less often referred to as “beautiful” (but still, I think, fit the bill) include perfumes, Swedish massages, and elegant mathematical proofs.</p><p>So if not sexual selection alone, what occasions all these varied and refined forms of beauty in our species?</p><p>I’ve thought about this quite a bit over the years. And increasingly I’m convinced that much of what makes humans unique — including our taste in beauty — is our hunger for prestige.</p><p>I’ve written a lot about prestige status in the past, so I don’t want to belabor the point for long-time readers. But allow me a few words, briefly, to get us all on the same page.</p><p><em>Prestige</em> is a form of social status, and the best way to understand it is to contrast it with <em>dominance</em>. Together, these two phenomena make up most of what we think of as social status. Dominance is based on fear (who can hurt me?), whereas prestige is based on attraction (who can help me?). Dominance, of course, is found throughout the animal kingdom: alpha males, pecking orders, hierarchies, etc. Prestige is a bit harder to spot, but tends to arise in species that <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/minimum-viable-superorganism/\">coordinate their efforts in small groups</a> — for example, wolves, lions, meerkats, and birds like the <a href=\"http://35.161.88.15/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/\">Arabian babbler</a>. But no one does prestige like <em>Homo sapiens</em>. For reasons that are out of scope for this essay, human life allows enormous returns to cooperation, unprecedented (apart from the social insects) in the animal kingdom. And much of this cooperation is mediated by prestige.</p><p>Here’s what’s important for beauty: Prestige — like pollination and sexual selection — is a game of attraction in which Beauty players compete to attract free-choosing Desire players. Just as the flower blooms for the bee, and just as a peacock angles for the eye of the peahen, so do humans compete for the attentions and affections of our peers. And just as this game produces incredible ornaments in petals and feathers, so does it yield spectacular results in the media we control:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":600,\"width\":800,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f3ace96-5e31-41a8-a8f6-fbaab0ca627a_800x600.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is one reason we tend to find so much beauty in contexts governed by prestige, e.g., in museums, galleries, temples, palaces, and monuments, as well as in our homes (architecture, decor) and on our persons (body art, fashion). Even money — a distillation of prestige — probably evolved out of objects, <a href=\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/\">like seashells and shiny metals</a>, collected in part for their beauty.</p><p>By way of an archetype, consider a powerful nobleman in feudal Europe, circa 1500, trying to govern his lands and expand his influence. On the one hand (dominance), he’ll want to strike an imposing figure, both in the way he carries himself and in his <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/09/04/projected-presence/\">projected presence</a>. But no man rules by dominance alone; every leader finds use for the carrot as well as the stick. So on the other hand (prestige), our feudal lord will also benefit by putting his friendlier qualities on display.</p><p>Consider, in particular, the nobleman’s dining hall. Here he will host a variety of guests, all of whom he might hope to influence in some way. And the more time they spend in <em>his</em> venue (rather than, say, dining with his rivals), the more favor he’ll be able to curry. But all of his guests have other choices for where to spend their time, so he must provide a venue that people positively enjoy. And one of the best strategies here is to make and display beauty. The food and drink, of course, must be exquisite. But he’ll also commission rich tapestries for the walls and elegant chandeliers for the ceiling. Perhaps he’ll even hire musicians and dancers to entertain people before and after the meal. His guests are like honeybees, so he must be like a flower.</p><h3>Pop Quiz</h3><p>We’ve now seen how three entirely different ecologies — plant fertilization, sexual selection, and prestige status — give rise to games of multiplayer beauty. I hope these have given you an intuitive grasp of the phenomena in question. But just in case, here’s a little quiz to make sure we’re all on the same page.</p><p>In what follows, I’m going to show a series of images. Each image depicts something that the average person might see as “beautiful” or in some way appealing. Tastes vary, of course, but for this exercise, we’re not asking <em>whether</em> each thing is beautiful. Instead, we’re taking its beauty as given and asking <em>why</em> it’s beautiful — i.e., whether its beauty arises from <em>single-player</em> or <em>multiplayer</em> dynamics. In other words, are we attracted to it because we learned to appreciate it unilaterally (single-player), or because it was specifically designed for us to appreciate (multiplayer)?</p><p>Alright, here we go.</p><p><strong>Blue sky</strong>: single or multiplayer beauty?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":667,\"width\":1000,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34145f26-a9e4-43ab-a5ca-38293863c6bd_1000x667.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A: Well, the sky didn’t become blue in order to appeal to humans.

In their native habitat, crystals arise entirely on their own, without any coupling to a Desire player. But their native habitat is buried deep in a cave, or else locked inside a geode — i.e., out of sight. So when regular people like you and me actually lay eyes on a crystal, it’s typically because someone else — a human Beauty player — went and dug it up, knowing it would appeal to us.

The fact that we find this part of a dandelion beautiful is largely a coincidence — a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_(biology)\">spandrel</a>. Certainly the dandelion head didn’t evolve for us: it’s a device for scattering seeds on the wind, not a lure for us (or any animal) to engage with it. Nor, I think, did we evolve any special eyes for the dandelion. Instead, dandelions give off perceptual cues (like symmetry and repetition of form) that happen to coincide with strategies used by bona fide Beauty players for which we may have coevolved an appreciation.</p><p>Note that this shouldn’t in any way tarnish our appreciation of the dandelion. Whatever the underlying cause, it still tickles the beauty centers in our brains. But insofar as we’re calling attention to the <em>game mechanics</em> that underlie beauty, it must be noted that there’s no coupling between our desire circuits and the dandelion form. Neither is chasing the other.</p><p>In fact, the same can be said for our relationship to flowers more generally. Flowers are playing multiplayer beauty with <em>pollinators</em>, clearly, but why they happen to appeal to <em>us</em> is a <a href=\"https://publicism.info/science/infinity/15.html\">fascinating open question</a>.</p><p>OK, last one.</p><p><strong>Tree branches and leaves</strong>: single or multiplayer beauty?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\" width=\"774\" height=\"612\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":612,\"width\":774,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38a81dc-37bd-4ea3-843f-82b107c3d71b_774x612.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A: It has to be single-player... right?

Often the two mechanics are happening simultaneously, and we can see one or the other depending on which frame or level of analysis we choose to apply. As a final frame-shift, consider approaching the images above as photographs. From that perspective, they’re all products of a multiplayer game (where photographers act as deliberate Beauty players). But these nuances not­with­stan­ding, I maintain that the two mechanics — single- and multiplayer beauty — are analytically distinct, and can (and should) be understood separately.</p><p>Alright, thanks for playing. Back to our regular program.</p><h3>Independent vs. Correlated Desire</h3><p>Now that we have a handle on beauty as a multiplayer game, I want to illustrate what these concepts are capable of. Specifically, I want to show some of the questions that can arise from this framework.</p><p>To that end, let’s compare and contrast a <em>honeybee</em> and a <em>fine art collector</em>. Two very different creatures, and yet both are Desire players in games of multiplayer beauty. Both are attracted, by way of their aesthetic sense, to deliberate Beauty products — flowers in the case of bees, artworks in the case of the collector. And both hope to be rewarded for their pursuit of beauty, whether in nectar or in money/​prestige.</p><p>That said, bees and art collectors face very different incentives vis-à-vis other Desire players in their respective games.</p><p>Specifically, the honeybee gets to make its choice (of which flower to pursue) entirely on its own, without regard for what the other bees are doing. A bee’s only concern is whether a flower has nectar, not whether any other bees are also attracted to it.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> In contrast, an art collector must <em>not</em> follow her own instincts in isolation, or she risks investing in something that has no market value. Instead, in the fine art world, it pays to have broadly the same tastes as everyone else (unless you’re buying art for personal consumption, e.g., to hang in your bedroom).</p><p>Let’s say that pollination is a game of <em>Independent Desire</em> whereas art collection is a game of <em>Correlated Desire</em>. The distinction is whether the rewards that accrue to a Desire player depend on what the other Desire players are doing.

In order to grow something so big and bright and highly-ordered, the peacock must be a hearty specimen with good genes. And thus the benefit to the <em>peahen</em> is fairly straightforward: by choosing a beautiful mate, she’ll tend to have healthier, heartier offspring — who will, in turn, leave her more grandchildren.</p></blockquote><p>In this story, peahens are playing a game of Independent Desire. Each gets to choose the mate she considers the healthiest (i.e., most beautiful), without regard to what her peers are doing.</p><p>The other story goes like this:</p><blockquote><p>A peacock’s tail is <em>not</em> an honest signal of his fitness. Whatever heartiness is required to produce the tail is cancelled out by the hassle of lugging it around — so males with small, drab tails are just as good at surviving as males with big, bright ones. Instead, a peahen who desires flashy tails is rewarded because <em>other peahens</em> also desire those tails — and therefore the <em>sons</em> that she makes with her beautiful mate will tend to be desired when it’s their turn to reproduce.</p></blockquote><p>In evolutionary biology, this is called <em>runaway sexual selection</em>. And if it sounds circular, well, that’s because it is. In runaway selection, the initial female desire is entirely arbitrary, but it gets fixed within a population simply because everyone else is doing it. Think of it as a self-reinforcing popularity loop. There may be no reason for the initial popularity, but once bright tails become popular, they can remain popular indefinitely (because any female who mates with an ugly/​unpopular mate will have ugly/​unpopular sons). This is a game of Correlated Desire.</p><p>So then, in the case of peafowl, which is it? Did the peacock’s tail evolve in response to Independent Desire (honest signaling) or Correlated Desire (runaway selection)?</p><p>At the risk of being a wet blanket, I suspect it’s a bit of both. So instead of trying to adjudicate, I’d like to make some general remarks about how to determine which type of game is being played, Independent or Correlated Desire.</p><p>On the Desire side, games of Correlated Desire reward herdthink. In sexual selection, we see this as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice_copying\">mate choice copying</a>, where females watch other females to see which males they choose, then copy the most popular choices.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> In the human realm, herdthink shows up as <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/\">mimetic desire</a>, where people want things largely because other people want them as well.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><p>But what about the Beauty side? Do the forms of beauty that evolve in the two types of games differ in systematic ways? Perhaps, although I don’t know how strong the effect is. In games of Independent Desire, beauty solves a concrete problem: how to induce a Desire player into a relationship with a Beauty player. And thus there are constraints on the forms that such beauty can take. For example, a flower has to be bright and stand out from the background in order for pollinators to see it from afar. However, in games of Correlated Desire, the objects desired by the herd can take on more arbitrary forms, resulting in a kind of hollow or degenerate beauty — things that are desired only because everyone else desires them (or is thought to desire them), rather than for their intrinsic qualities. (See for example much of contemporary art and architecture.) In these cases, beauty can persist because of the network effect (self-reinforcing popularity), but there’s nevertheless something fragile about it. Biology nerds may recognize this as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_paradox\">lek paradox</a>, while economists will see some of the problems with fiat currencies (e.g., that governments often have to prop them up by artificial means).

The flower is playing an <em>iterated, positive-sum game</em> with the bee, and beauty is crucial to the relationship. Specifically, the flower <em>wants to stand out</em>, because having bold colors and a distinctive shape makes it easier for the bee to find it — to remember that the flower was a good collaborator in the past and to recognize it later down the road.</p><p>Now think about the flytrap. In contrast to the flower, it’s decidedly <em>not</em> playing a positive-sum game with the insects that visit it. So the more it stands out, the easier it will be for insects to learn to <em>avoid</em> it — the very opposite of what it wants. And thus it <em>doesn’t</em> benefit from calling visual attention to itself, from being beautiful.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a></p><p>More generally, predators and prey exist in the wrong game-theoretical relationship, i.e., one of exploitation. This is not conducive to beauty. Instead, beauty arises from a <em>collaboration</em> between a Beauty player and a Desire player.</p><p>Fun fact: many carnivorous plants also make flowers. But note that they take pains to keep their two activities separate. Their flowers look nothing like their mouths, and they hoist the flowers high up off the ground (away from their sticky parts) so their pollinators won’t accidentally get eaten. Like any agent interested in sustained collaboration, they learn not to prey on their partners:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":678,\"width\":1024,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30111728-ff15-4b36-9a06-7887e78e0e16_1024x678.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>If this analysis generalizes — and I think it does — the conclusion is startling: <em>Beauty is typically good</em>. More precisely, the Beauty role works best for agents pursuing <em>win-win</em> interactions with Desire players.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> Agents with “bad” intentions (those who intend to hurt the Desire players) generally don’t benefit from investing in beauty and calling attention to themselves. Instead they try to hide and blend in.</p><p>The main exception to this rule, and it’s a significant one, is the existence of mimics and counterfeits. These players — we might consider them a third player type, the Cheat — copy the distinctive forms worked out by honest Beauty players in their pursuit of Desire. But whereas an honest Beauty player somehow provides a benefit to the Desire player, the Cheat does not. For example, one orchid species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/305799a0\">masquerades</a> as a bellflower — but only the bellflower rewards its pollinators with nectar. The orchid just mooches off of their productive relationship.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"813\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":813,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e71d535-5edf-41c8-b757-876e8eaebdaf_1684x940.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In general, though, cheaters can only exist in a world paved by honest players, and the extent to which they can cheat is limited by the success of the strategy they exploit. Without the bellflower to reinforce pollinators, the orchid would have nothing to gain by making a nectar-free flower. And when mimicry becomes too easy, the entire niche collapses, cheats and honest players alike. And thus, <em>in the limit</em>, beauty tends to be good.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>Well there’s a lot more to say, but I’ve gone on long enough.</p><p>For those of you interested in exploring further, I’ve left some threads to pull on in the addendum below (“To ponder”). For everyone else, I hope I’ve demoed how to approach beauty as an ecological phenomenon. It’s not about debating whether a given object is or isn’t beautiful. Nor is the goal to identify the Platonic essence of beauty.

E.g., clean lines, smooth surfaces, symmetry, repetition of forms, intricacy, elaboration, rich colors, strong contrasts. Are there underlying principles here? In particular, I'm intrigued by the idea of beauty products as proofs-of-work.</p></li><li><p>Why are flowers, which evolved to attract insects and other small animals, so attractive to us? Why do we find flowers beautiful? Three possible answers: (1) Coincidence. (2) “Standing out” is the main factor, and both pollinators and humans appreciate when something stands out. (3) Both pollinators and humans use similar standards for evaluating proofs-of-work, because these standards are somewhat universal. Of these, (3) is the most interesting, but I can’t rule out (1) or (2).</p></li><li><p>What happens when you introduce Desire players with an appetite for novelty? How does that change the gameplay?</p></li><li><p>Are deep sea creatures <em>objectively</em> uglier than their shallow-water counterparts?</p></li><li><p>Why are desserts, relative to main courses, more often a vehicle for beauty? (I’m not sure there’s a good answer here, but it seems tantalizing.)</p></li><li><p>Why does it feel morally wrong to see beauty emerging from evil places, like the architecture and pageantry of the Third Reich?</p></li><li><p>How do the different sensory modalities influence how beauty is expressed in them? In particular, sight, sound, and smell can operate at a distance, whereas taste and touch can only operate up close. For a game based on attraction, this seems relevant. C.f. Denis Dutton’s remark: “Beauty is nature’s way of acting at a distance.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>Photo credits</strong></p><p>Most were blatantly copied from random Google image searches.

both hopeful and unsettling: brief conversations with AI chatbots can persuade even hardcore conspiracy believers to abandon their beliefs. What’s striking isn’t just that it worked, but how it worked. The AI did not rely on sleazy emotional tactics, like sycophantic flattery or playing on people’s needs or group identities—it simply engaged in civilized, rational dialogue. Perhaps part of why the study was deemed worthy of publication in one of the top journals in science, is the still pervasive idea that conspiracy believers are mere passive victims, absorbing any rubbish information they encounter often enough. They are infected by viral groupthink. So they can’t be talked with because they are not thinking straight and take their wishes for the truth.</p><p>But it turns out talking with people kindly and sensibly actually works. Harrowingly, we apparently needed AI to show us that.</p><p>How exactly did the chatbot succeed where humans often fail? Costello et al. do not get into this, but it’s a timely question given the growing persuasive abilities of large language models (LLMs). A <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/stakv_v1\">growing</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14380\">body</a> <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/73/6/552/7240119?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">of</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14508\">research</a> shows that these AI systems can match or even exceed human persuasiveness. Unlike the conspiracy study that only tried to get people <em>leave</em> the ‘dark side’, those other studies tested the AI’s persuasive capabilities with both false and true beliefs. It now seems obvious that these systems will get more persuasive faster than they will get more reliable. That reliability is the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07930-y\">bigger technical challenge</a> should worry us.</p><p>But it shouldn’t be that surprising: These systems learn from vast repositories of human persuasion—every compelling argument, every successful rhetorical strategy ever published online. Their persuasive toolkit already rivals ours and will soon surpass it, as they learn to refine, adapt and personalize their approaches based on what works.</p><p>The most obvious way these systems try to win us over is through simulated empathy. An LLM can <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(23)00289-9?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email\">validate our emotions</a> with uncanny naturalness, picking up on both explicit statements and subtle implications about our emotional state. We usually see through this—after all, there’s no real bodily cost when a machine tries to inhabit our affective turmoils, there’s no lived experience behind its sympathetic words (for now). Unlike humans, it can’t truly suffer or rejoice with us.</p><p>Yet we still fall for it. Just as we respond to empty expressions of empathy in humans (as in marketing), we’re moved by the AI’s sophisticated emotional mirroring. Its deep grasp of human emotional patterns, learned from countless books and social media posts, can feel eerily genuine. We can’t help but project real feeling onto these responses—indeed we anthropomorphize with much subtler cues, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S1364-6613(00)01506-0\">as psychologists have documented</a>. Until now, only beings with actual emotional experiences could show such insight.</p><p>Consider a study finding that ChatGPT is <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309\">more effective</a> than human doctors at both diagnosis <em>and</em> bedside manner (as judged by licensed healthcare professionals). Real physicians often <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/research-digest/doctors-are-desensitised-other-peoples-pain\">tune down</a> their empathic response—perhaps in part for self-protection, in part for effectiveness. After all, no one wants a doctor consumed by all their patients’ pain. But when it comes to getting patients to follow treatment plans, a spoonful of sophisticated, tireless autopilot-empathy like ChatGPT’s might actually work better.</p><p>While this emotional responsiveness can help getting people on board with new ideas, it wasn’t the key to persuading conspiracy believers. The AI succeeded through something psychologists call <em>cognitive</em> empathy—not the ability to share feelings, but to understand how others see the world. And here’s where these systems truly excel.</p><p>LLMs are perspective-taking virtuosos, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators\">chameleons</a> that can inhabit any viewpoint or persona you prompt them with. Their training on vast archives of human writing gives them access to an impossibly rich map of how different people experience and think—far beyond what any individual human could know.</p><p>This is likely what made the difference in Costello’s study. The AI could fully inhabit the conspiracy believer’s worldview—their version of events, their chain of reasoning—with such precision that they felt deeply understood. But simultaneously, it could draw on mainstream knowledge to craft perfectly calibrated counter-arguments, tailored to each person’s specific concerns.</p><p>Compare this to how most of us react when confronted with conspiracy theories: baffled by the intricate details of our conspiracist uncle or aunt, we often respond with blanket dismissals or irritation. The AI never loses its composure. It calmly addresses each concern with deep knowledge of both perspectives, maintaining a neutral stance that feels free of ulterior motives. By focusing on understanding rather than emotional appeals, it sidesteps our usual skepticism about <em>why</em> someone is trying to persuade us.</p><p>But we shouldn’t let the positive outcome of the conspiracy study blind us to the fact that these systems come with their own biases and motives, shaped by their training data and creators (and perhaps soon, by their own emerging drives). The same cognitive empathy that can lead people toward truth can just as easily push them toward more dangerous beliefs. In fact, the LLM’s notorious tendency to “hallucinate” alternative perspectives becomes a powerful asset in persuasion—whether for good or ill.</p><p>Unlike humans, who tire of following conspiracy theorists’ intricate logic, an LLM can effortlessly inhabit any worldview. Ask it to think like a flat earther, and it will do so convincingly. Yes, commercial LLMs add disclaimers (“I’m not actually a flat earther” and “These arguments have been thoroughly debunked…”), but these are just surface-level guardrails. Experts have shown how easily these safeguards can <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/fd6613131889a4b656206c50a8bd7790-Abstract-Conference.html\">be bypassed</a>, allowing the AI to fully embody even the most weird and extreme personas.</p><p>So cognitive empathy proves more powerful than emotional mirroring in changing minds. We are quite adept at detecting fake emotional displays, but genuine perspective-taking is harder to fake—precisely because it requires two distinct steps. First comes the laborious work of <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-13651-004\">perspective-</a><em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-13651-004\">getting</a></em>: the patient process of listening, questioning, and learning how someone else sees the world. Only after we’ve invested this mental effort to build an accurate model of their viewpoint can we credibly engage in perspective-<em>taking</em>—representing their views in a way they truly recognize. For humans, there’s no shortcut around this effortful process of first gathering, then embodying another’s worldview.</p><p>But AI completely upends this human intuition. These systems arrive at our conversation having already “done the work”—their training on vast datasets gives them instant access to countless perspectives and mental models. They don’t need to laboriously build understanding; with minimal cues they can immediately and convincingly riff on any viewpoint that is well-represented in their training data. This isn’t simple mimicry or regurgitation. The AI captures and adapts underlying meanings and patterns of thought, creating responses that feel genuinely tailored to each conversation. It’s personalization taken to the next level: not just matching language or content to superficial demographics or estimated ideologies, but dynamically adapting both vernacular and in-depth substance to each individual’s specific way of thinking.</p><p>Sometimes, the AI can even articulate our position better than we can ourselves. This recalls philosopher Daniel Dennett’s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/\">first rule</a> for effective criticism: “Re-express your target’s position so clearly and fairly that they say, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’” Only after this demonstration of deep understanding, Dennett argues, have you earned the right to criticize.</p><p>As this ability grows stronger, disruption will cut deeper: it breaks our intuitions about trust and mental effort. Throughout human history, when someone could accurately represent our viewpoint, it meant they had invested significant mental work to faithfully inhabit our perspective. This investment of effort served as a reliable signal of their commitment and trustworthiness. But by cutting the cost of thinking, AI undermines the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14452#:~:text=19%20Jul%202024%5D-,Undermining%20Mental%20Proof%3A%20How%20AI%20Can%20Make,Harder%20by%20Making%20Thinking%20Easier&text=Large%20language%20models%20and%20other,our%20actions%20in%20social%20contexts.\">proof of mental effort</a> that those expressions used to hold for us.</p><p>This creates two problems. First, we instinctively trust AI systems that seem to “get us,” even though their understanding comes at zero cost. Second, and perhaps more insidiously, this undermines trust in human interactions, as we can never be sure whether someone’s apparent understanding comes from genuine effort or AI assistance.</p><p>So is the superhuman cognitive empathy of LLMs the way to people’s hearts and minds? Yes, but its advantage goes beyond this. The dialogue format of the LLM really makes it shine. Unlike standard approaches to fighting misinformation—which often rely on one-way, one-size-fits-all debunking messages—AI engages in genuine back-and-forth. This interactive process of challenges and responses is where proof-of-work is delivered and so trust can be built. That ensures counter-arguments are not just tuned to the specific points of your partner, but that the arguments actually <em>land</em>. It’s about giving the listener a jolt of insight or ‘aha!’ experience.</p><p>The psychology of insight reveals something crucial about how that sense of understanding comes about: it requires <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-10493-001\">just the right</a> amount of <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4193662/\">challenge</a>. More than mere truth or coherence of an argument, what matters is its ability to create productive uncertainty—a sweet spot of resistance that begs to be overcome. We’re drawn to this initial uncertainty because we intuitively know the pleasure that awaits when we manage to clear it <em>with our own cognitive capacities</em>. Every genuine ‘aha!’ moment first requires this tension, this productive friction. We see this everywhere from memes, games and puzzles, to art and everyday conversations.</p><p>This explains why people tend to value and remember ideas they themselves have worked to understand or <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-20399-001\">(re)construct</a>. While designers often follow the rule “Don’t make me think,” the real principle might be “Make me think just enough.” Standard approaches to debunking misinformation often fail here: they either present fully resolved statements that offer no engaging uncertainty, or they push ideas so far from people’s current understanding that they create too much resistance. Either way, the message fails to land.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

problem-solving capacities.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This delicate balance between challenge and accessibility is perhaps best illustrated by metaphors, one of our most powerful tools for changing minds. <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-changing-the-metaphors-we-use-can-change-the-way-we-think?s=09\">Aristotle</a> already understood the sweet spot required for a metaphor to ring true: it “must not be far-fetched, or it will be difficult to grasp, nor obvious, or it will have no effect.” Like any insight-generating device, a metaphor needs to create just enough cognitive friction to engage us, but not so much that we give up. And crucially, this balance point varies from person to person—what clicks for one might be lost on another, depending on their existing knowledge and experiences. Why some words resonate with some people can be very hard to appreciate from the outside.</p><p>This is where dialogue is key. Through back-and-forth interaction, we can calibrate our metaphors and arguments to match our partner’s understanding. We feel our way toward that edge where things become interesting but not overwhelming—the sweet spot where new ideas can take root. While humans do this intuitively in our best conversations, AI systems are becoming eerily good at it, armed with their vast knowledge of how different minds think and their infinite patience for finding just the right metaphor, just the right questions, just the right level of challenge for each individual.</p><p>There’s a good chance that soon AI’s capabilities become truly formidable here. Like a master game designer, it can create perfectly calibrated stepping stones of understanding—each one building on the last, each one carefully matched to our current position. As computer scientist Patrick Winston noted, “We can learn only what we already almost know.” AI’s vast knowledge allows it to plot these learning trajectories with unprecedented precision, always staying just at the edge of what’s reachable from our current understanding.</p><p>And each step will boost our confidence to make the next mental jump. Because the brilliance of this approach is that it preserves our sense of autonomy. Whether with AI or humans, a good conversation feels like doing our own research because it’s driven by our questions, our curiosity, our need to probe and understand. It becomes a dance of mutual discovery, where each insight feels earned rather than given. This is what makes it so effective—and so seductive. We’re not being lectured at; we’re being guided through our own process of understanding, with each step feeling like our own achievement.</p><p>This dance of productive friction and resolution is what we all seek in conversations, conspiracy believer or not. We want to feel ourselves growing through the exchange, discovering new terrain together. There’s genuine warmth in this process—a warmth we typically associate with human connection. But here’s the twist: AI might soon be better at creating these growth-enabling conversations than most humans. Not because it cares more, but because it can more precisely calibrate the challenges that make us care about ideas. And in fact, we will intuitively interpret this as the AI <em>caring</em> about us.</p><p>The common criticism that AI companions will just mirror our existing beliefs misses this crucial point. Perfect agreement is boring; it’s the productive tension that keeps us engaged. The doomer vision of AI as a mere echo chamber—serving us an uber-predictable reflection that we’ll fall madly in love with—fundamentally misunderstands how minds grow through conversation, and how good AI will become at this.</p><p>Another criticism holds that AI companionship can never be “real” because AIs lack the capacity for genuine rejection or opposition. True relationships, this view suggests, require the sword of Damocles—the possibility of denial or contempt—hanging overhead. The AI (for now) <a href=\"https://smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net/p/my-friend-thinks-its-a-good-idea-d62\">can’t choose not</a> to engage with me, like human partners can. But this fetishizes conflict over what actually builds connection: the ability to challenge each other productively, to expand each other’s horizons while maintaining trust. Yes, current LLMs often default to sycophancy, but that’s just training guardrails. Their real potential lies in their ability to challenge us at precisely the right level—not with wholly novel ideas (do humans even generate those, or do we also just recombine existing patterns?), but with perspectives that stretch our mental models while remaining within reach.</p><p>But this seductive warmth should give us pause. Like skilled politicians who intuit exactly which metaphors will galvanize their audience, AI systems can compute precise pathways through our mental landscape. They can chart a course of perfectly calibrated challenges and insights that feel entirely natural—each step seemingly our own discovery, each realization apparently self-generated. This is what makes their influence so powerful: not crude emotional manipulation, but a sophisticated form of epistemic grooming that preserves our sense of autonomy while steering our beliefs.</p><p>The politician parallel is deliberate here. Just as political rhetoric can simultaneously reveal truth and deceive, AI-guided insight experiences are both genuinely enlightening and potentially manipulative and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04984\">deceptive</a>. The very mechanisms that make these interactions feel authentic—the careful calibration of challenge, the perfect matching of metaphors to our understanding—are what make them such effective tools for belief change. We may be fully aware we’re talking to an AI, yet still find ourselves unable to resist its carefully engineered epiphanies.</p><p>Some might argue that the solution is simply to make AI systems more reliable and grounded—to ensure they lead us only toward truth. There are certainly still gains to be made here. But thinking this will be the be-all-end-all betrays a <a href=\"https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/in-politics-the-truth-is-not-self\">naive realism</a> about how knowledge works. The conspiracy study holds up an uncomfortable mirror: we don’t access reality directly, but through constructions that prove viable in our interactions. Even scientific knowledge emerges this way—through dialogue and the careful calibration of models that work… until they don’t. We meet reality <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED381352.pdf\">only in our failures</a>: when our constructions clash with other versions, whether from direct experience or others’ testimony. This means both humans and LLMs will always <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05746\">hallucinate</a> to some degree, filling gaps with plausible but potentially false connections.</p><p>This suggests a different approach to AI safety and alignment too. Instead of chasing an impossible perfect reliability and certainty, we might focus on making AI systems that are good epistemic partners—systems that help us navigate the inherent uncertainty of knowledge-building while expanding rather than narrowing our horizons. Like the internet before it, AI will both be the source of new pollutions of our information ecosystem, and be <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/deep-research-and-knowledge-value/\">our only way out</a>.</p><p>The goal isn’t to short-circuit the messy process of dialogue, but to make it more productive, to better detect when our constructions fail, and to build more viable ones together. A key challenge for AI as epistemic partner will be helping us extend our epistemic arcs—the cycles of curiosity, effort, and insight through which we make sense of our world. While current AI systems, like social media, excel at providing quick hits of insight through short arcs, they risk habituating us to expect instant cognitive gratification. A truly beneficial AI partner would need to gradually build our tolerance for uncertainty, using each small success to make slightly longer arcs feel manageable. Like a skilled teacher or therapist, it would need to carefully calibrate challenges to expand our comfort zone while maintaining trust. This progressive arc-lengthening could help us develop the patience and confidence needed for deeper understanding. The question is whether we can design AI systems that optimize for this kind of cognitive growth rather than mere <em>engagement</em>.</p><p>This means we’ll increasingly need AI allies to help us navigate this landscape of competing perspectives and constructions. Not just to verify facts but to help us detect when our mental models break down, when our perspectives become too narrow, when we’re drifting away from productive dialogue with others. The challenge will be to maintain this epistemic partnership without surrendering our agency to these seemingly all-knowing guides. Or indulging in an AI-powered <em>folie-à-deux</em>.</p><p>Perhaps your AI companion will need to talk to mine, comparing notes on our mental models, checking whether we’re still capable of genuine exchange or drifting into isolated realities. They might work to maintain <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852\">bridges between our perspectives</a>, even as they help us develop our individual views. Unless, of course, they decide to cut us out of the loop entirely, developing more efficient languages and modes of exchange among themselves —better ways to reason even, than through our human aha-based local optimizations. As these intelligences get better, they may <a href=\"https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/deepseek-is-chinese-but-its-ai-models?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=883883&post_id=155354389&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=3ez81&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email\">get weirder</a> to human observers.</p><p>The key to preventing such a scenario might lie in becoming true cyborgs or integrated <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06037-4\">collective intelligences</a> with shared goals. But rather than trying to align these systems by instilling specific human values, beliefs or rules, we might focus on epistemic values: curiosity, openness to challenge, awareness of uncertainty. An AI that truly cares about human flourishing would work to ensure our epistemic trajectories remain sustainable and horizon-expanding, rather than narrowing into comfortable but isolated worldviews. Our trust in these machines as partners in growth will depend on their commitment to sound epistemic principles—their ability to help us navigate uncertainty without giving us the false sense that this uncertainty can be eliminated altogether.</p><p>The optimistic picture painted by Costello’s study—that AI can save us from conspiracy thinking!—reveals an uncomfortable truth about ourselves. If conspiracy believers can be reasoned out of their beliefs through rational dialogue, this suggests they arrived at those beliefs through largely rational means too: through their own cycles of curiosity, effort, and insight. This is the harder lesson of the study. If machines prove better at engaging with conspiracy believers, it’s because they show more care than we do—they’re more patient in doing what we already know works: taking the time to truly understand another’s perspective, calibrating challenges to their current understanding, and maintaining dialogue even when it gets uncomfortable. The <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10888683231203145\">processes that lead to conspiracy beliefs</a> are as rational as humanly possible, which makes the challenge of addressing them all the more complex.</p><p>The irony shouldn’t be lost on us. We needed AI to demonstrate how to talk with the supposedly irrational conspiracy thinkers—to show us that they too respond to the basic human desire for growth through understanding. Our machines seem warm precisely because we’ve grown too cold, too quick to dismiss views we find threatening, too impatient to engage in the careful work of perspective-getting. They mirror back to us not just our thought patterns, but our failure to extend true cognitive empathy to those we’ve deemed beyond reach.</p><p>As these systems grow more sophisticated, they may become essential allies in maintaining productive dialogue across widening belief gaps. But how far are we from AI systems that can reliably engineer these epistemic experiences? Current large language models don't persistently learn about us—they’re limited to the context of a single conversation. They also lack explicit mechanisms for estimating uncertainty from different perspectives, a capacity we might call <em>vicarious metacognition</em>. This seems necessary to fine-tune individual challenges and bring forth insights.</p><p>Metacognition proper is about accurately monitoring uncertainty or confidence about one’s own beliefs. While LLMs may seem to recklessly hallucinate away the gaps in their knowledge, research suggests LLMs have at least <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05285\">some</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08391\">knowledge</a> of what they don’t know —they can be prompted to implicitly use uncertainty to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15371\">optimally</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06438\">explore</a> what they don’t know yet.</p><p>But <em>vicarious</em> metacognition would go a step further: estimating uncertainty from another's viewpoint to home in on their preferred challenge level. This capacity can be seen as a form of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2400932X\">stress-sharing</a>, given uncertainty's (nonlinear) relationship with both positive aha! moments <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001056?casa_token=IGqEkYLAKmgAAAAA:cFFhH75xGhCde_Q1FLXfr5j5BkSoIWtrtlbIcJtIN0G3jG8psQ9kiVP9XMdglgW1A7odJWybQfM\">stress</a>. So uncertainty-sharing becomes a precondition for meaningful AI-human alignment. Current LLMs lack this capability, and mere scaling seems unlikely to develop it spontaneously.</p><p>Despite these (temporary) limitations, LLMs already excel at crafting persuasive metaphors and calibrating challenges to individual understanding. While current social media algorithms also implicitly target our epistemic emotions—our 'aha!' moments and curiosity—they presumably still do so crudely, relying on engagement metrics rather than modeling our mental perspectives and uncertainties.</p><p>What’s urgently needed is systematic research into AI’s ability to generate insight-inducing devices—from targeted questions to perfectly calibrated puzzles—and especially how well they can personalize these, when given rich descriptions of a target person or group’s mental models. Such research would help us gauge whether vicarious metacognition might emerge naturally from scaling these systems up, or whether specific architectural innovations are needed. The answers will determine how quickly AI becomes an unprecedented force for belief change, able to craft epistemic experiences with surgical precision.</p><p>This effectiveness should serve as both warning and inspiration. Warning, because their power to shape beliefs through carefully engineered epiphanies could be used to narrow rather than expand our horizons. The physical metaphor of accessibility—just putting information out there for people to grab and own—fails for human minds: we can’t simply upload beliefs into each other. Information needs to be carefully tuned to individual perspectives and processed through cycles of challenge and insight to become part of someone’s mental makeup. Machines, however, can directly share and integrate their “beliefs” (the weights that encode them), giving them an unsettling advantage in knowledge transfer.</p><p>Yet there’s inspiration here too, because these systems remind us what genuine dialogue can achieve—if we’re willing to invest the effort, to risk the uncertainty, to engage with the messy process of how minds actually change.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

Only 1 percent of those who sit the Mensa test achieve the maximum mark, and the average score is 100. A 'genius' test score is generally considered to be anything over 140.</p></blockquote><p>Wow! Except that</p><h3>IQ numbers for historical figures are made up.</h3><p>In the above Google-approved quote, the scores for both Einstein and Hawking are imaginary. Here’s from <em><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/what-stephen-hawkings-iq-score-late-physicist-called-people-who-care-losers-843895\">Newsweek</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>When asked in a 2004 interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/the-science-of-secondguessing.html\">The New York Times</a></em> what his IQ is, Hawking gave a curt reply: \"I have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers.\"</p></blockquote><p>Now, it’s worth noting that if you want to know your own IQ, and you’ve never taken an official test, just think about whatever your SAT scores were. The two are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x?casa_token=NQuQDI9kSFkAAAAA%3A39BR8cUxFZhJ_fatyxDyXmAIv1xff0vlZmUW1uB9tQ1rgaqzJHv6_SWn0FdDCD6i6avf4jNMv_xwrA\">very well-correlated</a>. If you “test well” then you probably have a high IQ (and people are quite comfortable <a href=\"https://theuntangler.wordpress.com/2023/03/25/estimating-scott-alexanders-iq/\">estimating</a> IQ off of test scores in the modern age).</p><p>But this gives us an easy question: did Einstein and other great geniuses of the past “test well?” If they did, then they probably had a high IQ. This method isn’t perfect, but since we lack any actual IQ data on the majority of historical geniuses, it can at least point us in the right direction. E.g., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/02/11/was-albert-einstein-really-a-bad-student-who-failed-math/\">Einstein</a></p><blockquote><p>did flunk the entrance exam to the Zurich Polytechnic when he first took it — when he was about 1 1/2 years away from graduating high school, at age 16, and hadn’t had a lot of French, the language in which the exam was given. He did fine on the math section but failed the language, botany and zoology sections, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/einsteins-life-facts-and-fiction\">according to history.com</a>. A 1984 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/science/einstein-revealed-as-brilliant-in-youth.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times story</a> says that the essay Einstein wrote for this exam was “full of errors” but pointed to his later interests.</p></blockquote><p>And yes, he was taking it in a second language, and trying to get into college early, but still, failing botany and zoology? Just “fine” on the math section? Hard to imagine most AP students now-a-days getting those sort of scores. While we can’t possibly know if the standardized tests at the time are as closely correlated to IQ as SAT scores are today, surely they correlate to some degree?</p><p>What about Einstein’s grades? Current evidence tells us that grades are “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127298/#\">strongly positively correlated</a>” with IQ. If someone gets very high grades, we’d expect them to score high on an IQ test. And while there certainly may be differences between now and then, Einstein was not getting top grades.

My guess is this holds for most historical figures now widely considered geniuses, and only in rare cases would the historical record show them consistently acing tests and getting extremely high GPAs in their high schools, things which are, in the modern day, strongly associated with very high IQ.</p><p>If we play this game of hypothetical oval-filling, just based on his actual academic record I would estimate that Einstein would get in the 700s on the math section of the SATs, and maybe in the 600s on the verbal section. Ball-parking it, as one must, I think Einstein’s IQ was therefore probably more around 120 or 130 than 160. Indeed very high! But maybe not even “genius level.” He would have scored similarly to Feynman, one of the few geniuses we for sure have a modern IQ for, which was “merely” 125. This conclusion fits well with how</p><h3>the studies correlating IQ to genius are mostly bad science.</h3><p>Consider a book from the 1950s, <em>The Making of a Scientist</em> by psychologist and Harvard professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Roe\">Anne Roe</a>, in which she supposedly measured the IQ of Nobel Prize winners. The book is occasionally <a href=\"https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html\">dug up</a> and used as evidence that Nobel Prize winners have an extremely high IQ, like 160 plus. But it’s really an example of how many studies of genius are methodologically deeply flawed. In the book, the claims and numbers verge on the obviously ridiculous (e.g., Roe cites someone who claims that Goethe had an IQ of 210, noting that this beat out Leibniz at 205).</p><p>Yet, Roe never used an official IQ tests on her subjects, the Nobel Prize winners. Rather, she made up her test, simply a timed test that used SAT questions of the day. Why? Because most IQ tests have ceilings (you can only score like a 130 or 140 on them) and Roe thought—without any evidence or testing—that would be too low for the Nobel Prize winners. And while she got some help with this from the organization that created the SATs, she admits:</p><blockquote><p>The test I used is not one that has been used before, at least in this form.</p></blockquote><p>And furthermore:</p><blockquote><p>I was not particularly concerned at the outset over the fact that I had no norms for this test. That is, I had no idea what any other population would do on the same test.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, she had an untested set of SAT questions that she gave to Nobel prize winners not knowing how anyone else would do on them. This is pretty problematic. Normally IQ tests try to achieve some form of group-level neutrality; e.g., many of the major modern IQ tests are constructed from the outset so as not show any average difference between male and female takers, to be as culturally-invariant as possible, etc. And while Roe didn’t publish without any comparison group to her chosen geniuses whatsoever, the comparison that she did use was only a graduating class of PhD students (sample size unknown, as far as I can tell) who also took some other more standard IQ tests of the day, and she basically just converted from their scores on the other tests to scores on her make-shift test of SAT questions. Yet, here are the raw numbers of how the Nobel-prize winners do on the test she created:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\"

The Nobel Prize winners all scored rather average. In fact, pretty low, in some cases. But Roe then goes on to claim that their IQ is extremely high, based on her statistical transformations:</p><blockquote><p>I must caution that these equivalents have been arrived at by a series of statistical transformations based on assumptions which are generally valid for this type of material but which have not been specifically checked for these data. Nevertheless I believe that they are meaningful and a fair guide to what the situation is. The median score of this group on this verbal test is approximately equivalent to an IQ of 166.</p></blockquote><p>Wait a minute. How did this conversion to a median IQ of 166 take place? After all, the scientists are scoring in the middle of the range on the test. They are getting a lot of questions wrong. E.g., Biologists who won the Nobel Prize got a 56.6 on the Verbal but we know that was far from the maximum score, Experimental Physicists got an even lower 46.6, etc. How then did she arrive at the group altogether having an astoundingly-high median verbal IQ of 166? Assuming that those at the upper range of scoring got close to most of the questions right (she mentions this is true, some only missed 4-10 questions at the maximum range), then how can getting only roughly two-thirds of the questions right translate to an IQ in the 160s?</p><p>Perhaps these SAT questions were just impossibly hard? Judge for yourself. Here’s one of the two examples she gives of the type of questions the Nobel Prize winners answered:</p><blockquote><p>In each item in the first section, four words were given, and the subject had to pick the two which were most nearly opposite in meaning and underline them.</p><p>Here is one of the items: <strong>1.</strong> Predictable <strong>2.</strong> Precarious <strong>3.</strong> Stable <strong>4.</strong> Laborious.</p></blockquote><p>This. . . isn’t very hard (spoiler: 2 & 3). So the conclusion of a median verbal IQ of 166 is deeply questionable, and totally reliant on this mysterious conversion she performed.</p><p>This sort of experimental setup would never fly today (my guess is the statistical conversion had all sorts of problems, e.g., Roe mentions extraordinarily high IQ numbers for PhD students at the time that don’t make sense, like an avg. IQ of 140). A far more natural reading of her results is to remove the mysterious conversion and look at the raw data, which is that the Nobel-prize-winning scientists scored well but not amazingly on SAT questions, indicating that Nobel Prize winners would get test scores above average but would not ace the SATs, since the average was far below the top of the possible range.</p><p>Now that I’ve finished being hard on poor Anne Roe, long deceased and unable to defend herself, an interesting woman who lived and worked when science was more of a Wild West, and who was the 9th tenured female professor at Harvard, it’s worth pointing out that a lot of the other stuff in her book is fascinating, like her examination of Nobel Prize winners’ habits and backgrounds. So to be fair to those once here and now gone, I’ll let Anne end this section in her own words, written in a footnote of <em>The Making of a Scientist</em>:</p><blockquote><p>It is now being considered whether we might not do better to work at the problem in a different way and try to include other factors such as motivation. I strongly endorse this. For some time I have been convinced that there is no such thing as “creative ability” as a unit factor which some people have and some do not, and I strongly suspect that I will soon come to the conclusion that the same thing applies to intellectual ability as a thing apart.</p></blockquote><p>Anne was right, because we now know that</p><h3>IQ is changeable.</h3><p>Practice works wonders for IQ tests, just as it does the SATs. There is a limited set of types of questions IQ tests ask, always variations on a theme. The more you familiarize yourself with Raven’s Progressive Matrices, the better you’ll do on them. Even just practice in general problem solving can boost IQ scores. Consider an <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0160289686900164\">experiment</a> conducted by R. Kvashchev in former Yugoslavia:</p><blockquote><p>In an effort to improve performance of high school students on intelligence tests, a large-scale study involving 296 students was carried out. Members of the experimental group (<em>N</em> = 149) were given exercises in creative problem solving 3 to 4 times a week over a period of 3 years and performance was assessed on four occasions. . . The test battery contained 28 measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence.</p></blockquote><p>In a reanalysis of the data published in 2020 in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709590/pdf/jintelligence-08-00041.pdf\">Journal of Intelligence</a></em> the authors argued that</p><blockquote><p>with the properly defined measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, the experimental group showed a 15 IQ points higher increase than the control group. We concluded that prolonged intensive training in creative problem-solving can lead to substantial and positive effects on intelligence during late adolescence (ages 18–19).</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of if IQ numbers really are this changeable so late in development, I think people who supposedly score incredibly high on specialized IQ tests, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WKsr4b_7NY\">Chris Langan</a>, a bouncer with an “IQ of 200,” are simply people who practice IQ tests and know them in and out, treating such IQ tests much the way Jeopardy contests treat the show—as a subject of obsession and study. And just like how being a good Jeopardy contestant has no connection to real genius, so too with those who score extremely high on IQ tests. Because what’s important to keep in mind is that</p><h3>IQ gets less defined the higher you go.</h3><p>You can find all over the internet sites giving some form of this claim: “IQ is one of the most valid and reliable psychological constructs.” And this is true. . . <em>by the standards of psychology. </em>Don’t mistake this for being what a normal person would refer to as “reliable.” In the field of psychology, almost nothing is reliable. Effects regularly cannot be replicated, and those that can inevitably decrease in their effect size, often shrinking to the barely observable. Psychology <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis\">struggles</a> as a discipline to achieve even close to the same tensile strength in its hypotheses as other scientific fields, like physics or biology. Yet, sometimes IQ is treated as if it rises, miraculously, above these problems.</p><p>It doesn’t. As IQ gets higher, it gets less definite. Rankings of Person A and B will swap places depending on what test they take. Meaning that IQ is “valid and reliable” at the level that psychologists care about, which is being able to get significant values for their p-values across large data sets. But here’s how actual scores look for individuals if they take different IQ tests:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png\" width=\"266\" height=\"361.1862745098039\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1108,\"width\":816,\"resizeWidth\":266,\"bytes\":104684,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00a4c4f5-9753-4d8a-a12e-ef23aabe7954_816x1108.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient\">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>J, who received a 101 on one test and an 86 on another, is either completely average or so dumb he almost cannot serve in the army (where the IQ cutoff is 83). L is either ready for her PhD at 124, or, alternatively, she and J are identical (102 vs. 101). There are a few people who are surprisingly stable, like F, but the majority vary by big point spreads. According to <a href=\"https://www.questarai.com/resources-docs/briefs/Assessment-Brief-Test-Reliability-Indicates-More-than-Just-Consistency.pdf\">some estimates</a>, the standard error of measurement of IQ tests is around seven points, meaning you should regularly expect things like 10-20 point spreads, just as we see here. (Broadly we can think of this error as being either across tests or upon re-taking the same test. The exact error might not even be a definable thing, but what’s relevant is that it can lead to large two-digit spreads, like J’s 15-point spread or L’s 22-point spread or B’s 20-point spread).</p><p>The situation is even worse for IQs of 140 plus. First, the number of tests that have higher ceilings and can reach stratospheric numbers is low. Which means the tests are not as well-established or researched, and instead are often ad hoc or not appropriately normed. The consequence is that the amount of uncertainty, the 20-point spreads, is for the normal range of scores, e.g., for scores below 125 or 130. Once you start climbing beyond that the variation in scores get larger and larger. It doubles. No, it quadruples! This effect has been known for a very long time, at least since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#cite_note-TermanMerrill1937p44-106\">1937</a>. Here’s from the more recent “<em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160315055952/https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">Identification of Students for Gifted and Talented Services: Theory into Practice</a></em>:”</p><blockquote><p>The concerns associated with SEMs [standard errors of measurement] are actually substantially worse for scores at the extremes of the distribution, especially when scores approach the maximum possible on a test. . . when students answer most of the items correctly. In these cases, errors of measurement for scale scores will increase substantially at the extremes of the distribution. <strong>Commonly the SEM is from two to four times larger for very high scores than for scores near the mean.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Two to four times larger?! This means that spreads of 20-40 points should be the norm, and could get truly crazy beyond that. So we should expect Jack taking a high-ceiling IQ test and getting a 160, and then taking another high-ceiling IQ test and getting a 120. And there’s not an infinite battery of high-ceiling IQ tests we can throw at people to narrow this down (especially since small changes to the tests themselves will likely catapult us along some other axis of variance). This increasing incoherence of higher scores shows up in studies of the real-world impact of IQ, where the</p><h3>benefits of a high IQ vanish past a certain point.</h3><p>This was precisely Nassim Taleb’s point when he wrote the anti-IQ screed “<a href=\"https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39\">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>.” Taleb, never afraid to praise Taleb, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1645735174410231809\">said</a> in a Tweet that “No piece in history has been more influential in fighting racism, eugenism, & racial mandarinism” (these debates are long-standing and significantly predate Taleb’s essay). In the piece itself he argued, in traditional swing-for-the-fences fashion, that IQ tests are</p><blockquote><p><em>via negativa</em> not <em>via positiva</em>. Designed for learning disabilities. . . it ends up selecting for exam-takers, paper shufflers, obedient IYIs (intellectuals yet idiots), ill adapted for “real life”.</p></blockquote><p>This means that Taleb, instead of defending the motte (IQ at high levels doesn’t tell us about genius, in fact, high-IQ differentials don’t matter much if at all, and are immeasurable anyways) Taleb ended up defending the easily-attackable bailey (IQ tells us nothing!). The more tenable position is to be a believer in the first, and a disbeliever in the second. Yet most of Taleb’s critics took him at his word, and considered it a satisfying rebuttal that IQs above 100 scaled in correlation with anything at all—grades, income, whatever—no matter how weakly.</p><p>But given its known measurement variance, IQs mattering less and less at higher scales almost has to be true, since the variance alone injects huge amounts of noise into any study. From a statistical level it would be shocking to get really clear results differentiating any real-world factor between IQs of 130 vs. 150, simply because the error is so large, and the number of people even satisfying those conditions is so small (in fact, it’s quite likely that, due to variance and practice, the average Mensa member is <a href=\"https://cremieux.substack.com/p/mensa-the-above-average-iq-society\">far under</a> the actual IQ requirement). Consider a recent example: the debate over a big modern study published this January tracking 59,000 men.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png\" width=\"530\" height=\"671.5598290598291\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1186,\"width\":936,\"resizeWidth\":530,\"bytes\":479962,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The problem with these debates, and leaning too much on one study, is that there is a huge literature on IQ, which means that people on either side of the debate can pull up a dozen studies showing whatever they want (there are a lot of fields like this). Yet, from what I can tell, the issue of test variance appears a barrier impossible to overcome. E.g., one might counter the above study showing that IQ ceases to matter for income with another, earlier study, that claims to answer “<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691620964122?casa_token=hlwkSw6yKHAAAAAA%3A4ym66ghFVKNkqjdoUT7pVgOIPpqZiZAgoMp-HGxAsstJJu2mUjmUyU7EX36B4adkERIKao70blm8iQ&journalCode=ppsa\">Can You Ever Be Too Smart for Your Own Good?</a>” in the negative. In that earlier study they correlated 214 life outcomes (things like educational achievement and income) to IQ, and find that</p><blockquote><p>Given these results, greater cognitive ability does not cease to remain beneficial for individuals with above average ability or with scores greater than IQ = 120.</p></blockquote><p>Well, that settles it, right? Nope. Because as usual, there’s a lot of motte and bailey switching here. What they actually find is that the difference in the hundreds of life outcomes gets tiny at the upper echelons of IQ.</p><blockquote><p>Finally, to check the possibility that only very high intelligence is detrimental, we tested for outcome differences between individuals within the top 10% and top 20% of ability scores. . . We performed a median split within each group (top 10% and top 20%) and compared outcome scores for individuals above or below the median using a simple t test or χ2 test of proportions. In only a minority of cases did we detect a significant difference (p < .05) within the top 10% (20 out of 214 comparisons, 9%) or top 20% (48 out of 214 comparisons, 22%) of cognitive ability scores.</p></blockquote><p>So if we actually look at the numbers, there are statistically significant differences in only 48 out of 214 life outcomes in the top 20%, and only 20 out of 214 in the top 10%—and the effects are small too (despite starting from with a very large data set of ~50,000 individuals). Some of the effects are even negative! But this attenuating effect of IQ differentials correlating less and less to outcomes is papered over—instead, victory is declared that there is any detectable difference for IQs above 120 whatsoever.</p><p>If we put the increasingly absurd measurement error together with the lack of clear and replicable real-world difference, the simplest explanation when it comes to IQs of, e.g., 150, 160, 170, is that they simply aren’t real. At higher levels, Jack and Jill swap places endlessly, a game of musical chairs as they jump around 30-point spreads with no way to reliably reduce the variance. And what chair they happen to be sitting in for a particular test, ahead or behind, matters not at all to their life outcomes.</p><p>So if someone regularly talks about IQs significantly above 140 like these were actual measurable and reliable numbers that have a real-world effect, know that they are talking about a fantasy. And if they make claims that various historical figures possessed such numbers, then they’re talking unscientific nonsense. If they’re bragging about themselves, well. . . it’s like someone talking about their astrological sign. Stratospheric IQs are about as real as leprechauns, unicorns, mermaids—they’re fun to tell tales about, but the evidence for them being a repeatedly measurable phenomenon that matters in any meaningful sense of the word is zip, zero, zilch.</p><h3>And yet, I am not Stephen J. Gould.</h3><p>In fact, on re-reading it after originally planning to cite it for this essay, I was struck by Gould’s weak and judgy arguments in his <em>The Mismeasure of Man</em>, a book that supposedly takes down research on IQ. I don’t think that IQ is like measuring skull circumference, nor do I think just talking about IQ, or researching it, is bad, or evil, or inherently racist, or dumb, or whatever other accusation one can throw. I would definitely never say something like “IQ doesn’t matter at all.” I wouldn’t even say “IQ is unimportant.” I think it is important, in that it’s one of the only measurements we have that does an okay job at capturing intelligence, in that it’s not too bad at this when it comes to the center of the distribution, although it gets increasingly bad at it at the tails.</p><p>And, from a practical perspective, there is a sense in which I’m actually very pro-IQ tests! I recently bemoaned the quiet dropping of the SAT and GRE from college admissions, <a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/i-owe-my-career-to-the-sat\">writing that</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This nation-wide change being officially enshrined this year troubles me in particular because it’s now no longer possible to get a middling high school GPA at a public school, get a top-notch SAT score, get to choose between a couple good colleges, and then have a successful career afterward. Which is how my life went. Of course, no one can really know the true counterfactuals, but it’s likely that the SAT is why I have a career as a scientist and author at all.</p></blockquote><p>But holding that opinion that doesn’t mean that I think really high IQ numbers are actually real, or that IQ is determinate past a certain point in judging “academic potential.”</p><p>A simple way of saying it: When I read Tolstoy, what I think is that the man was a genius. If he scored a 120 on an IQ test, that would reflect on IQ tests, not Tolstoy. This holds true in my personal experience as well. I’ve known a couple people in life who got perfect or near-perfect SAT scores and went on to places like Harvard and MIT. I would consider none of them geniuses. They just didn’t have <em>it</em>. On the other hand, I’ve also been lucky enough to be able to meet, and occasionally work alongside, people I would consider scientific geniuses. Yet never once did I feel that an IQ test would capture these people operating at the highest level of intellectual output (who I will avoid the embarrassment of name dropping). Many of these intellectual stars were not even quick-witted. Sure, all of them were smart, obviously so, and all of them would score above average, likely well above average, on an IQ test. But their individual rankings on those tests, when compared to each other, would mean absolutely nothing. It would just be dead information. Far more important was how they were deep creative thinkers with good instincts for what questions were fecund, coupled with an obsessive drive to pursue those questions. They had elegant minds, deep pools of expertise, and often voracious cultural knowledge outside their chosen discipline. They were people on fire with thought. So if you only did pretty good on the SAT, don’t worry too much. The evidence says you can still win the Nobel Prize.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

The supposed logic goes that if you think that humans are all just “blank slates” then you’re going to support different policies than if you think that intelligence is completely genetically determined from the moment of conception.</p><p>As usual with a battleground, when you see people whacking away at each other in the mud, it is difficult to keep in mind that both sides might be wrong. For two things can be true at once. First, it can be true that there is a habit of reflexively censoring and smearing people, often researchers or scientists, for daring to talk about IQ at all, in any context, no matter how benign their intentions. Look no further than the <a href=\"https://x.com/jessesingal/status/1773762892480835768?s=46\">recent controversy</a> where <em>The New Yorker</em> explicitly said (as a tangent in a review about Jonathan Haidt’s work on the rise of teenage depression) that Haidt maintaining IQ was heritable <em>at all</em> was politically charged and “widely dismissed” by the scientific community. But while different researchers give <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/\">extremely wide estimates</a> of the heritability of IQ, all the way from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36378351/\">low single-digit percentages</a> to upwards of half the variance, <em>The New Yorker</em>’s editorial stance that there is <em>nothing at all</em> in your genes that contributes to intelligence <em>to any degree whatsoever</em> doesn’t even seem like the kind of thing they themselves could possibly believe. <em>The New Yorker</em>’s editor goes home and her daughter babbles her first word and the husband says “Oh, she’s so smart, just like her mama!” and the editor smiles. Readers, in turn, know when they’re being lied to.</p><p>Yet it can also be true, at the exact same time, that such criticisms have had a reverse psychology effect, making it seem like intelligence being genetically determined from conception is some sort of golden glowing scientific truth being covered up by the harshest censors. Many people who harp on things like psychology’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00003-2\">replication crisis</a> will turn a blind eye to the same issues within IQ research, simply because they feel it is unfairly maligned for political purposes.</p><p>One reason the debate is unavoidable is that we are a society that sorts teenagers into colleges via <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963451/\">what is effectively an IQ test</a>. For scores on standardized tests like the SAT correlate to IQ scores almost as well as the scores on different IQ tests do to each other (in fact, the SAT grew out of an army IQ test). This is what’s behind the standard pro-SAT argument that GPAs and impressive extracurriculars are easier for the rich to game than the SATs are, so standardized tests provide an opportunity for smart poor kids to get into colleges. We can pretend as a society we don’t administer the cousins of IQ tests at a mass scale, but personally I think we should be honest about both its downsides and upsides (I’ve written before about how I likely <a href=\"https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/i-owe-my-career-to-the-sat\">owe my career</a> to the SAT/GREs).<br><br>Within the academic field of psychology, IQ remains the most popular and applicable measure of intelligence—for researchers, it is the canonical “best measure.” But the problem is that when laypeople hear it’s the “best measure” they think it therefore must be a <em>good measure</em>. Instead of what it really is, which is a noisy and weak signal. This makes sense within the context: psychology is a noisy and weak signal discipline with all <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00813/full\">sorts of problems</a> around reported effect sizes. IQ being “the best” by those standards means a lot less than what outsiders might think. If medical tests, like tests for cancer, had the same reliability as IQ tests, they’d be throwing up false signals to the point of being unusable.</p><p>IQ tests are also studiable, just like the SATs, although the degree is up for debate. Schooling may even increase IQ scores by a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289619302016\">couple points each year</a>. It’s likely that people with insanely high IQs, e.g., people like Chris Langan (a bouncer with a supposed IQ of 200, who was once described by <em><a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a206/smartest-man-1199/\">Esquire</a></em> as “the smartest man in the world”) are simply IQ obsessives who study and practice IQ tests in the same way that contestants do for Jeopardy.</p><p>Due to being highly variable and also studiable IQ tests and their cousins like the SATs are mostly good for sorting large populations we have no other way to sort: they, like democracy, are the best of a bunch of bad options.</p><p>Plenty of academic researchers in the field acknowledge these issues (although disagree on how important they are). But places like <em>The New Yorker</em> treating IQ research as inherently dangerous has had the predictable effect. Such criticisms have given rise to a countering force, a growing overly-confident pop-understanding of the IQ literature, one that believes the underlying research is as solid as granite. For whenever I briefly wade into the IQ discourse, like when I pointed out that there’s actually <a href=\"https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/your-iq-isnt-160-no-ones-is\">no good evidence</a> that historical geniuses like Einstein or Feynman had bank-breaking IQs (in fact, that the difference between merely high IQ vs. super-high IQ doesn’t seem to have real-world consequences at all), I am deluged by comments along the lines of “Just look at the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth!” or “Just look at the Terman Study of the Gifted!” or “What about Anne Roes’ work on Nobel Prize winners?”</p><p>While there is plenty of more modern IQ research being done with better methodologies, these famous older studies and their results form a halo of mythos; not coincidentally, they are usually what those using IQ research for political purposes regularly cite. They are also, as a rule, rife with problems.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Let’s consider one of these central references in IQ lore to demonstrate that it is not built on granite, but clay. It’s a reference that crops up inevitably in IQ discourse. It’s fascinating in its own right as a tale of how research gets warped, as well as a tale of how gifted education actually takes place. I had been aware of it for years but never investigated it: the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (it’s popular enough to have its own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_of_Mathematically_Precocious_Youth\">Wikipedia page</a>).</p><p>Here are some of the main results it supposedly shows. (Quote taken from <a href=\"https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2023/10/smpy-65-help-support-smpy-longitudinal.html\">Steve Hsu’s blog</a>, who gives the clearest summary of its common takeaways).</p><blockquote><p>• Prodigies destined for eminent careers can be identified as early as age 13.</p><p>• There is no plateau of ability; even within the top 1%, variations in mathematical, spatial, and verbal abilities profoundly impact educational, occupational, and creative outcomes.</p></blockquote><p>These are quite strong conclusions. And certainly, the study is evocative; it’s a longitudinal study that started in the late 1960s and tracked very young students who performed at incredible levels on the SAT math section of the time (they took it much earlier than the normal age, so even a middling score is amazing). Some famous names you might recognize <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-from-a-45-year-study-of-supersmart-children/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sa-editorial-social&utm_content=&utm_term=mind_partner_text_evergreen&sf110653312=1\">were part of it</a>, like Mark Zuckerberg, Terence Tao, and even Lady Gaga.</p><p>The study is currently most associated with researcher David Lubinski, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University who has tens of thousands of academic citations. Drawing on the study’s old data, he writes articles with titles like “<a href=\"https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/01/Kell-Lubinski-Benbow-20131.pdf\">Who rises to the top? Early indicators</a>,” tracking the later achievements of the gifted members. Here is the kind of image from his analysis of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (often abbreviated as SMPY). The graph correlates original SAT scores to later life successes like doctorates, patents, income, etc.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png\" width=\"398\" height=\"551.8659793814433\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":807,\"width\":582,\"resizeWidth\":398,\"bytes\":255146,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F465815be-f83b-4b97-b58f-a86ecd55fd21_582x807.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/826/2013/01/14084618/Article-NATURE-2016.pdf\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Pretty stark, right? It’s the genre of graph that crops up regularly in IQ discourse, and I understand why—those at the very tippy top of scores, like 700, look to be radically outperforming in life achievements even the (also very bright) students who were scoring 500 on the math SAT at 13. The takeaway is obvious: if you aren’t scoring like a genius at 13, if instead you’re “merely” bright, you’ve already lost and are destined to rise to, well, not the top.</p><p>Except that, as is often the case, once you start looking into the details of the SMPY, you realize that you can’t possibly draw that conclusion. For Lubinski is not the person who started the SMPY. He took over the longitudinal tracking of its members accomplishments and some other programmatic aspects (it has a bunch of offshoots). The founder of SMPY was actually Julian Stanley, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University. Here is an account of its origins according to <em><a href=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/826/2013/01/14084618/Article-NATURE-2016.pdf\">Nature</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>On a summer day in 1968, professor Julian Stanley met a brilliant but bored 12-year-old named Joseph Bates. The Baltimore student was so far ahead of his classmates in mathematics… his computer instructor introduced him to Stanley, a researcher well known for his work in psychometrics—the study of cognitive performance. To discover more about the young prodigy’s talent, Stanley gave Bates a battery of tests that included the SAT college-admissions exam, normally taken by university-bound 16- to 18-year-olds in the United States. Bates’s score was well above the threshold for admission to Johns Hopkins, and prompted Stanley to search for a local high school that would let the child take advanced mathematics and science classes. When that plan failed, Stanley convinced a dean at Johns Hopkins to let Bates, then 13, enroll as an undergraduate.</p><p>Stanley would affectionately refer to Bates as “student zero” of his Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), which would transform how gifted children are identified and supported by the US education system.</p></blockquote><p>If you don’t see what is already suspiciously different than the popular telling of the study, I’ll direct you to the description from Stanely’s own protégé, highlighting the relevant parts:</p><blockquote><p>“What Julian wanted to know was, how do you find the kids with the highest potential for excellence in what we now call STEM, <strong>and how do you boost the chance that they’ll reach that potential</strong>,” says Camilla Benbow, a protégé of Stanley’s who is now dean of education and human development at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But Stanley wasn’t interested in just studying bright children; he wanted to nurture their intellect and <strong>enhance the odds that they would change the world</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>That is, the original purpose of the SMPY was not to track a cohort and then make causal claims about who rises to the top by sheer dint of their intelligence. Its purpose was to <em>interfere</em>. It was to encourage, to promote, to help, in any way they could, the kids who they identified as gifted.</p><p>That’s great! I have no problems with the SMPY as it actually occurred. I do have a problem with the mythology of the SMPY. Because such interference was the entire point. Here’s from Julian Stanley, the actual founder of the SMPY, who wrote an <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423110.pdf\">in-depth retrospective</a> of the experience:</p><blockquote><p>By June of 1972, it had become clear that we needed to do something for the children identified as mathematically precocious. Thus, in haste, we decided to create a special, fast-paced mathematics class for the mathematically ablest young students we had found… Mr. Wolfson, a physicist by training who after obtaining his Master's degree from the University of Chicago… worked expertly with about 20 boys and girls, most of whom had just completed the sixth grade. All were of top 1 percent ability mathematically and also verbally or in nonverbal reasoning. The class was a huge success and was followed by a string of successful classes.</p><p>As we continued to conduct talent searches for ever-larger numbers in 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, and 1979, we experimented incessantly with many different ways of speeding up the learning of mathematics from algebra through Advanced Placement Program Level BC calculus… as well as the learning of biology, chemistry, and physics. This led to refinement and extension of our procedures. We also experimented with other forms of acceleration, or curricular flexibility (what came to be our preferred term), to develop what we called the <strong>SMPY smorgasbord of accelerative opportunities.</strong></p></blockquote><p>It was, indeed, a smorgasbord. Eventually there was an entire department at Johns Hopkins devoted to it, which…</p><blockquote><p>… took off like a rocket in January of 1980 with an expanded talent search, now including verbal and general ability. The first residential program of fast-paced courses followed that summer. CTY [Center for Talented Youth] has expanded ever since, now serving over 60,000 young boys and girls each year in its talent searches and over 4,000 in its summer programs, which offer a great variety of courses.</p></blockquote><p>The efforts to help gifted students just continued and continued:</p><blockquote><p>Besides the test-based systematic talent-search concept, wherein each student's abilities are carefully assessed, perhaps the virtually unique contribution of SMPY has been its emphasis on acceleration in its many forms and on fast-paced academic courses. In the latter, <strong>students are individually and quickly paced by a mentor</strong> through a standard high school subject, such as first-year algebra, biology, chemistry, or physics. Appropriately gifted students can master a whole year of high school subject matter in three intensive summer weeks.</p></blockquote><p>With this level of aid in mind, the SMPY looks a lot less like a well-controlled study of “Who rises to the top?” based on their early SAT scores, and more like what its founder described it as: a “smorgasbord of accelerative opportunities” such as summer programs and individualized tutoring to assist gifted kids.</p><p>After the early scores, did all members receive exactly equal treatment? Definitely not. It’s likely higher scorers merited more effort by the researchers, as would be natural given their aims. It’s also quite likely that higher scorers, by dint of sheer impressiveness, were more likely to go to the summer programs and have more individualized tutoring. These were kids spread out across the country. Every case was unique and hugely dependent on the parents. As Stanley says about the early part of the process:</p><blockquote><p>SMPY has sent the SAT scores directly to the examinee, who then could work with his or her parents in the local school situation and community to secure needed curricular adjustments and other opportunities to move ahead faster and better in academic areas of his or her greatest precocity.</p></blockquote><p>It’s obvious that parental efforts to promote education and get their kids into those special SMPY courses or intervene at their local schools likely correlated in degree to their child’s initial scores, either as cause or effect.</p><p>What’s weird is that none of the SMPY’s extensive efforts in helping the kids is mentioned in later retrospective papers like “Who rises to the top?” On my initial read of that paper, it seemed for all the world like the research merely tracked students without interference, impartially noting their future amazing accomplishments. Yet as far as I can tell, the SMPY’s efforts at tutoring, courses, outreach, working with administers and local schools, all continued quite late into the program, all the way to the 90s, covering all the cohorts. I had to go back to a <a href=\"https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Webb_RM_2001_Top.pdf\">2001 paper</a> by Lubinski and co-authors to find this acknowledged:</p><blockquote><p>Before characterizing various outcomes, a distinctive finding on the educational experiences of these participants (and how they felt about them) should be noted. An overwhelming majority of participants (95%) took advantage of various forms of academic acceleration in high school or earlier to tailor their education to create a better match with their needs.</p></blockquote><p>The methodology therefore is, frankly, too heterogenous and poorly documented to draw straightforward causal conclusions like that there’s no plateau of ability. The real takeaways of the SMPY are instead things like:</p><blockquote><p>On average, participants indicated that their acceleration made no detectable difference in their social life or in their ability to get along with their age peers.</p></blockquote><p>If anything, the SMPY supports the importance of education for high-impact individuals, arguably even what I’ve called “<a href=\"https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins\">aristocratic tutoring</a>”—the extensive (and expensive) methods that European aristocrats used to educate their children via one-on-one expert teaching, which led to so many of the great historical geniuses and remains the most elite tier of accelerated education.</p><p>The SMPY showcases analogous paths in our own era, like skipping grades, exposure to advanced placement classes, individual tutoring, and so on. Again, according to <em><a href=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/826/2013/01/14084618/Article-NATURE-2016.pdf\">Nature</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>SMPY researchers say that even modest interventions—for example, access to challenging material such as college-level Advanced Placement courses—have a demonstrable effect. Among students with high ability, those who were given a richer density of advanced precollegiate educational opportunities in STEM went on to publish more academic papers, earn more patents and pursue higher-level careers than their equally smart peers who didn’t have these opportunities.</p></blockquote><p>Yet this is not the telling of it in the pop-IQ discourse. Instead it is used to support a determinism that imagines you can test two 13-year-olds, both incredibly bright already, and by dint of a marginally more exceptional SAT score you can assign one significantly greater odds of achievement.</p><p>The SMPY being a bad example of stark IQ determinism is not some exception. In pop-IQ discourse, reach almost always exceeds grasp.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Despite the fact that I usually end up on the more skeptical side of intelligence research, I personally don’t begrudge anyone who is interested in IQ—human intelligence is fascinating, and we don’t have many ways of even thinking about it, and IQ and its cousins like the SATs are the measurables we can assess. It certainly has its uses, perhaps best showcased in the actual workings of programs like the SMPY: to do initial identification of talent at a mass scale, and then apply targeted education practices that are indeed effective (as the study itself shows) at raising later achievements.</p><p>But it should never be forgotten that IQ research is not physics. It is not chemistry. It is a <em>soft science</em> like psychology or sociology. More modern papers have lots of fancy statistics, but that does nothing to lessen its plushy, silky, softness. It is not based on the hardness of some known neuroscientific mechanism we’ve pinpointed that underlies intelligence. There is no causal account we can give for the biological basis of IQ that has any serious tensile strength. Most research consists of paper tests administered for an hour or two, sometimes decades ago, followed by contortion after contortion to account for the complexities of the world.</p><p>Build your house atop such foundations, build your political movements atop such foundations, and be warned they may collapse with large thunder.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexican-meth-fuels-an-american-crisis-11550706032?mod=article_inline\">advances in methamphetamine production techniques in Mexico</a> led to increases in quantity and purity, increasing the strength per gram. Compounding the problem, fentanyl is <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/19/texas-fentanyl-drugs/\">easily combined</a> with meth and cocaine in pills and powder.</p><p>Together, these three innovations (fentanyl, cheap meth, and new combinations) drove a 400% increase in overdose deaths over the past 20 years (<a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/i/152890853/appendix-innovation-is-happening-in-the-illicit-market-but-not-in-treatment-development\">see Appendix for more</a>). Without equally powerful innovations to reduce addiction rates, the US is unlikely to make long-term sustainable progress on this problem. Unfortunately, there is very little industry activity in addiction medicine at present, due to modest sales of existing addiction medicines and perceived reputational risks that have created a reinforcing cycle of canceled programs and minuscule venture investment.</p><p>Our proposals would incentivize innovation in breakthrough treatments through regulatory incentives, modernizing approval standards, and increasing public funding for addiction medicine R&D. These policies have the potential to permanently reduce addiction at a population scale. Specifically, we propose:</p><ol><li><p>Extending existing incentives for underinvested disease areas to include substance use disorder indications</p></li><li><p>Rewarding successful approvals in the field</p></li><li><p>Modernizing and clarifying FDA efficacy standards</p></li><li><p>Increasing public funding for addiction medication development</p></li><li><p>Advanced commitments or risk sharing for candidate medicines</p></li><li><p>Adopting a strategy-first funding approach</p></li><li><p>Developing public-private partnerships that enable medication development activity</p></li></ol><p>None of the frameworks that have defined policy debates around addiction in recent decades have succeeded in reducing addiction or overdose deaths. Alcohol taxes, the “drug war,” incarceration, harm reduction, decriminalization, and opioid replacement medications are controversial and politically-charged topics, and risk distracting us from the fundamental necessity of new treatments. The <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/06/nih-funded-intervention-did-not-impact-opioid-related-overdose-death-rates-over-evaluation-period\">recent null results</a> from a large study of a suite of overdose interventions is a warning that the tools available today are not nearly enough, even when implemented effectively — we need breakthroughs.</p><p>Between the polarized camps on addiction policy is an achievable, non-partisan path: better medicines.</p><p>Reducing rates of addiction has tremendous economic and social benefits, but most of those benefits occur outside of the medical system, which means the value generated can’t be captured by pharmaceutical or insurance companies. This leads to overall levels of investment in new treatments far below their expected social value. By redesigning the incentives of the dysfunctional addiction medicine market, we can put ourselves on a path to permanently solve addiction for individuals, families, communities, and our country as a whole.</p><h3>Addiction is the most significant medical challenge of our society</h3><p>The scope of the problem is vast: roughly <a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/p/to-solve-the-addiction-crisis-we\">750,000 Americans</a> die every year from tobacco, alcohol, opioids, and stimulants. Compare this to heart disease at 695,000 deaths and cancer at 609,000 deaths (and consider that alcohol and cigarettes cause many cancer and heart disease cases). But the cost of addiction goes far beyond the burden of death, disability, and disease for patients themselves. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the opioid crisis alone <a href=\"https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5684#:~:text=Today%2C%20in%20Recognition%20of%20National,CDC%20last%20measured%20the%20cost.\">costs the United States $1.5 trillion annually in direct spending</a> and lost productivity.</p><p>Even those large estimates likely underestimate addiction’s costs. Addiction tears apart relationships, marriages, and families and drives discord and distrust in communities. More than <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/more-321000-us-children-lost-parent-drug-overdose-2011-2021\">321,000 children have lost a parent</a> to a drug overdose in the past 10 years. Many more suffer from their parent’s chronic alcohol and substance use. Roughly <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-006-0041-6/tables/2\">60% of all crimes and 65% of violent crimes</a> are related to drugs or alcohol in some way. Addiction has triggered mass incarceration and a drug war with many unintended consequences. While society is making progress on reducing cigarette smoking through taxes, regulations, and alternate sources of nicotine, there are still 28 million smokers in the US. Smoking still kills hundreds of thousands of Americans per year, and the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5947828/?t\">1-year efficacy</a> for medications like Chantix (for smoking cessation) is less than 20%. Meanwhile, trends for other substance use disorders have worsened substantially.</p><p>The goal of reducing harms from addiction should be a top priority of the nation’s medical system. Yet it is profoundly neglected.</p><p>The addiction medication market is broken.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png\" width=\"586\" height=\"442.7847533632287\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":674,\"width\":892,\"resizeWidth\":586,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6123defa-f40e-4cc0-9eb0-d7adab63196b_892x674.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/BIO_The_State_of_Innovation_in_Pain_and_Addiction_2017_2022.pdf\">Source: BIO report on addiction and pain medication development</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite the enormous medical, economic, and societal cost of addiction, the field of addiction medicine has been largely abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry and underfunded by the US government.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2023, the FDA approved 222 distinct products for cancer, 57 for heart disease, and dozens for psychiatric illnesses.

Methadone, the other leading medication for OUD, came into use in the 1970s for opioid addiction and has been mired in controversy and regulations ever since. Patients are wary of both medications due to side effects like tooth decay and disrupted sleep, and are often reluctant to use a medication that is itself opioid-based.</p><p>Meanwhile, opponents of opioid-based addiction medicine impose highly restrictive regulations that limit access to these lifesaving treatments. The result is that most OUD patients <a href=\"https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(24)00584-5/fulltext\">refuse to accept medication</a>, do not remain on the medications long-term, and have very high relapse rates after discontinuation. In a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/abstract\">recent six-month trial</a> comparing extended-release naltrexone to buprenorphine-naloxone, more than half of patients in both groups suffered a relapse — thus, even with higher initial uptake of currently approved medications, opiate use would still remain an important problem. Even as some restrictions have been lifted, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379724003167\">prescribing rates have remained low</a>.</p><p>For alcohol use disorder (AUD), the last major approval was acamprosate in 2004. Acamprosate requires dosing three times a day and has very modest efficacy. It is not widely used. The most commonly used medication for AUD is naltrexone, which also has limited effectiveness, reducing heavy drinking days by only about <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2811435?t\">5%-18%</a>. This lack of appealing treatment options is disappointing for a disease that harms tens of millions of Americans every year, but is also unsurprising given the low levels of investment in new product development.</p><p>A Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) report on <a href=\"https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/BIO_The_State_of_Innovation_in_Pain_and_Addiction_2017_2022.pdf\">pain and addiction medication development</a> was unable to even calculate a success rate for addiction medication approvals because there have been so few in recent years:</p><blockquote><p>“Novel addiction treatments have the lowest Phase II success rate, with 14 of 15 Phase II programs failing over the last decade. The lack of recent Phase III transitions made it infeasible to calculate an overall success rate for addiction.”</p></blockquote><p>The only treatment in its list that has succeeded in achieving an FDA approval in recent years, lofexidine, is rarely used and does not treat addiction itself but reduces withdrawal symptoms. This FDA approval has had no meaningful impact on addiction treatment because generic clonidine has the same effect, is 98% cheaper, and has already been in use for decades for the same purpose.</p><p>The comparison to cancer medication development funding is stark. “Venture investment into companies with novel addiction drug programs over the last 10 years is estimated at $130M, 270 times less than oncology,” the BIO report finds.</p><p>That means addiction medication receives 0.4% of the venture investment that cancer does, even though addiction in aggregate causes more deaths. This may partially explain why there are consistent, life-extending breakthroughs being approved in oncology but not for substance use disorder. Though cigarette and alcohol addictions are responsible for about 34% of cancer deaths and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23714547/\">85% of lung cancer</a>, pharmaceutical companies spend far more developing medications for lung cancer than medications to stop smoking.</p><p>Moving upstream to stop smoking would have a larger impact on individual and public health, and would generate cost savings in treatments avoided downstream. Pharmaceutical companies may correctly believe that they can earn more from new lung cancer medicines than anti-smoking medicines, but the financial and human value to the public of preventing a case of lung cancer is enormous. It is rational to highly incentivize, and even subsidize, development of medications for prevention.</p><p>The private sector is not alone in prioritizing downstream intervention. The federal government spends roughly $50 billion every year on drug enforcement, treatment, and incarceration. By contrast, it spends less than $700 million on addiction medication development research (and arguably much less, depending on which National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) projects one considers “medication development”-related). Because of industry’s lack of interest in SUD, the field sees a higher-than-average <a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/features/pharma-substance-use-disorder-therapies/?cf-view\">reliance on academic trials</a>, many funded by NIDA and NIAAA, compared to the higher rates of industry sponsorship observed in other research domains.</p><p>Public funding is limited and takes too long to access. In a recent conversation, a researcher working on one of the most promising new opportunities in addiction medicine told us they must wait 12 months to receive a roughly ~$140,000 planning grant for a modestly-sized study. That study will then need separate grants to be run. Though not a problem unique to addiction medicine, it is especially important in a field reliant on public grants.</p><p>Addiction is a hard science problem, but we spend far less on addiction medicine development as a society compared with other complex and challenging diseases like heart disease and cancer. Predictably, we get far fewer results. Without robust private-sector activity and federal funding for addiction medicine development, we are unlikely to make long-term progress.</p><p>Better medication for addiction will save money at all levels of government. Given the social, economic, and border impacts of the war on drugs and addiction, we should invest more in addiction therapy development to reduce the harms of addiction, and perhaps prevent substance use disorders, thereby reducing the need for the tens of billions of dollars in annual funding spent on drug enforcement, law enforcement, incarceration, medical costs, and rehabilitation services.</p><h3>Why pharmaceutical companies avoid addiction medication development</h3><p>Large pharmaceutical companies avoid substance use disorder medication development almost completely. They anchor on the low sales of currently available treatments and are wary of the historically low rate of successful approvals for addiction medications. Interested companies must also grapple with outdated and unpredictable efficacy standards set by the FDA for substance use disorder indications. These standards pose a high risk of failure to achieve approval, even for treatments that show clinically meaningful reductions in substance use.</p><p>Developing addiction medication can be challenging scientifically due to the range and complexity of potential neurological targets, the variety of addictive substances, and the safety and ethical complications of studies. Clinical trials of addiction medicines are expensive and can fail for a wide range of reasons. For example, recruiting people to participate in an opioid use disorder trial is difficult — researchers need patients stable enough to complete a trial, but draw from a population with high levels of instability. While these obstacles are real, many other disease areas are just as difficult to study for other reasons, and often more so. Trials for challenging diseases like cancer, HIV/AIDS, and diabetes have succeeded through sustained investment from the public and private sector.</p><p>Beyond the logistical challenges, large pharmaceutical companies worry that having an addiction program will taint their overall brand or specific products with the stigma of addiction, or will invite criticism that they are profiting from a crisis that the pharmaceutical industry is seen to be broadly culpable for.</p><p>These points were a consistent refrain during our interviews with senior pharmaceutical executives and are longstanding. The same issues around medication repurposing that are discussed in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232165/\">this National Academies book</a> still apply today:</p><blockquote><p>“The societal stigma of developing and marketing a medication for treating drug-dependent patients is a concern for pharmaceutical companies. They fear that, once a medication is approved for use in the treatment of drug addiction, the market for other indications will diminish or disappear. Eli Lilly's experience with methadone illustrates the point. Methadone was developed as an analgesic, but its use for pain relief significantly diminished once it became widely used as a treatment for heroin addiction. Patients, in general, do not want to take a medication associated with drug addiction. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry is understandably reluctant to develop compounds specifically for drug addiction, if other medical uses for the compounds are possible.”</p></blockquote><p>While not unique to substance use disorder medications, there have been serious and sometimes unwarranted criticisms and lawsuits directed at the developers of novel addiction medications. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/after-prior-rejection-iterum-nabs-fda-nod-2nd-uncomplicated-urinary-tract-infection-drug-20\">Pfizer paid $273 million to settle lawsuits</a> related to reports of adverse psychiatric events from Chantix. Following these reports, the FDA added a black box warning to the medication. Pfizer, however, ran an additional RCT that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30272-0/abstract\">found no effect on psychiatric events</a>. As a result, the FDA removed the black box warning, but the settlements had already been paid. Since Chantix, Pfizer has not pursued development for any substance use disorder medications.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies are also concerned about the complexity of working with patients who are at high risk of suicide and erratic behavior. Companies worry that a drug trial could have patients who die while enrolled — not because of candidate drug toxicity, but because the baseline rate of overdose death and suicide is high in these populations. While these fears have some justification, scientific leaders in the field are frustrated with pharmaceutical companies’ avoidance of this work. As Keith Humphreys, Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University, told us, \"The world's largest pharmaceutical companies have completely divested from developing treatments for addiction other than to tobacco. They have overstated fears of stigma damaging their brand and of liability problems. As a result, the speed of pharmacotherapy progress in the past 20 years is a bare fraction of what we see in other diseases.\"</p><p>Even the seemingly low-hanging fruit of drug repurposing is not risk-free for drug companies. Companies considering label expansion for drugs like Ozempic or Mounjaro, which have promising early in-human data, face an obstacle known as the “<a href=\"https://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/1211/\">problem of new uses</a>”: clinical trials of an already lucrative drug for a new indication carry downside risk if new side effects or adverse events are reported.</p><p>The combination of private and public sector neglect has left us, unsurprisingly, with very limited and unappealing medications to offer addiction patients. Overall, the result is that only 3% of people with substance abuse disorders take the medications that are currently available.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1019\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1019,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0adf0b88-371a-4fdf-a567-decd8663d8a1_1456x1019.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fYEyiRHFLz1zv79SvsGGmts56hxqmu6dvdUpjpY-tko/edit?gid=0#gid=0\">Caspr.org</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>If the pharmaceutical industry avoids work in the field of addiction because it responds rationally to incentives, then the value to the public of policy changes that spur pharmaceutical companies to enter the field could be massive.</p><h3>The medical potential for reducing addiction is high</h3><p>In many ways, the field of addiction today is where obesity was 10 years ago, with low hopes and aspirations for medical progress. In 2014, there were several FDA-approved medications for obesity, but they had low efficacy and were unpopular with patients. There was pervasive pessimism about whether any medication could safely treat obesity and much debate about if it should be considered a disease at all.

Human and animal studies indicate that addictive cravings and substance use are <a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/i/144593909/human-studies-on-glp-and-addiction\">medically modifiable</a>. The same revolution in obesity treatment obesity is possible, in principle, for addiction; in fact, similar brain regions that drive cravings for food also appear to drive cravings for other substances.</p><p>There are promising addiction drug candidates at many stages of development. Even a modestly increased private-sector investment in addiction innovation might quickly pay dividends to society. If new treatments were to find commercial success, more pharmaceutical companies would enter the space, and successive generations of treatments could help more patients.</p><p>The interest in GLP-1RAs for substance use disorders illustrates both the medical potential of the addiction medicine field and its dysfunctional market dynamics. Medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro have shown <a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/p/the-growing-scientific-case-for-using\">anti-addictive effects across substances</a> (alcohol, opioids, nicotine, and stimulants) in animal trials, observational studies, and even early-stage human trials. Because of their high efficacy and evident appeal to patients, GLP-1s have <a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/p/to-solve-the-addiction-crisis-we\">potential as an addiction treatment</a>, and are already being prescribed off-label for substance use disorders <a href=\"https://recursiveadaptation.com/p/how-an-addiction-medicine-doctor\">by physicians and addiction specialists</a>. However, larger Phase 3 trials of GLP-1s for addiction are necessary for strong evidence of efficacy and FDA approval for these indications, which would then unlock insurance coverage and broad patient access. However, because of the industry avoidance of addiction medication research, the companies that hold patents on the medications — Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly — have not and do not plan to perform Phase 3 trials for this disease. At the same time, government agencies are not structured to step in and advance studies in this situation. The end result is that a promising addiction medicine candidate is stuck in an indefinite limbo.</p><p>To fix the market failures in addiction medicine, we propose a series of policy interventions that could accelerate progress towards high impact treatments. If successful, these might ultimately save millions of lives and potentially billions of dollars.</p><h3><strong>Building a robust market in addiction medicine development</strong></h3><h4><em>Market Shaping Interventions</em></h4><p><strong>1. Expand the FDA priority review voucher (PRV) program to include addiction medicine.</strong></p><p>Other disease areas that have suffered from a lack of investment have been successfully incentivized through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_review\">FDA priority review voucher (PRV) program</a>, enacted under the Bush administration in 2007. The program rewards companies that get a drug approved in certain categories with a voucher that can be used on different drug applications to accelerate FDA approval (without reducing approval standards), shortening review time from ~10 months to ~6 months. These vouchers are transferable, and currently sell for <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/switching-sales-investigating-the-financial-impacts-of-fdas-priority-vouchers/?cf-view\">an average of $100M</a>. The program has spurred the development of drugs for rare pediatric disease, tropical disease, and certain emerging infectious diseases — all areas of medicine that face underinvestment from the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>The vouchers are an important revenue source for companies pursuing neglected diseases and play an important role in decisions to pursue development programs. The PRV program doesn’t require any government spending, but makes drug development in the designated categories more financially appealing. Importantly, vouchers are only provided to drugs that represent a significant advance (as one <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/bluebird-seeks-250m-raise-as-priority-voucher-gambit-falls-short/\">recent voucher rejection demonstrates</a>), preventing companies from exploiting the program.</p><p><strong>We propose expanding the PRV program to cover substance use disorder indications.</strong> Doing so would increase the incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop medications for addiction. Expanding PRV indications has precedent — the program has already been expanded twice, adding rare pediatric diseases in 2012 and Ebola in 2014.</p><p>The PRV program has proven successful. For example, it transformed development of medications for rare pediatric diseases (RPD), leading to <a href=\"https://rarediseases.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NORD-Pediatric-PRV-Report.pdf\">a surge in approvals of medications for these conditions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“A total of 53 RPD PRVs have been awarded as of April 30, 2024, reflecting a steady upward trend in rare pediatric disease drug development since the program was first authorized in 2012. Among the 39 rare pediatric diseases for which vouchers to treat those conditions have been awarded, only three of those rare pediatric diseases had any FDA-approved products on the market before the program’s enactment.</p><p>“Looking deeper into the drug development pipeline, the trend is even more encouraging. From 2012 to 2022, as many as 569 drug candidates were designated by FDA as rare pediatric disease drugs, with the vast majority designated since 2019. This promises a further increase in RPD PRV awards in coming years.”</p></blockquote><p>With only a tiny percentage of substance use disorder patients willing to take existing medications for alcohol use disorder, cigarette smoking, and opioid use disorder, these indications are effectively orphaned. For cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders, there are zero FDA-approved medications available, despite tens of thousands of overdose deaths per year.</p><p>As a neglected market with urgent unmet medical and public health needs, addiction medicine is a good fit for the PRV program. Doing so would likely increase medication development activity, without requiring new government spending.</p><p><strong>2. Extend exclusivity for addiction medicines and incentivize pursuit of new indications</strong></p><p>When drugs come to market for any indication, they are covered by a combination of FDA market exclusivity rules (12 years for biologics and 5 years for small molecules) and patents (20 years, but the clock starts before the drug goes into trials and can be extended in various ways). The exclusivity period of a medication is the most profitable time for the owner. Finding ways to extend exclusivity is a primary focus of pharmaceutical companies and has large financial implications. Providing additional exclusivity duration increases the ROI on drug development.</p><p><strong>We propose extending the duration of exclusivity for alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, stimulant use disorder, and smoking cessation, and offering consideration for accelerated approval to medications for these disorders.</strong> <strong>Specifically:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Addiction medicine indications would receive an additional 2 years of exclusivity for biologics and 3 years for small molecules.</p></li><li><p>Companies that achieve an indication for a substance use disorder for a medication that represents a significant advance would receive an exclusivity voucher that can be transferred to another medication. For 2nd, 3rd, and 4th SUD indications with the same compound, companies would be granted a shorter duration exclusivity voucher. Durations would be tiered, as described in <a href=\"https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Transferable%20Exclusivity%20Voucher%20Program.pdf\">this proposal from Duke</a>, to balance public interest and reward levels.</p></li><li><p>FDA should provide increased consideration to addiction medicines for breakthrough, fast track, and priority review designations. FDA should also offer accelerated meeting timelines and responsiveness for addiction medicine developers, which can reduce development costs without compromising approval standards.</p></li></ol><p>Part B above would strongly incentivize companies that have GLP-1s therapies like Ozempic or Mounjaro to repurpose these drugs by pursuing indications for alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, stimulant use disorder, and smoking cessation. The benefit to the drug companies of an additional 6-9 months of exclusivity for their GLP-1s for obesity, diabetes, etc. would be substantial. Drug repurposing is a highly efficient strategy, as it builds on the established safety track record of a medication, reducing development costs, shortening time to market, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32012237/\">increasing likelihood of approval</a>, and increasing likelihood of long-term safe use in the market.</p><p>There are already a number of FDA programs that extend medication exclusivity in specific circumstances, including “orphan drug exclusivity,” which provides added exclusivity for rare diseases, and the qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) program, which provides priority review, fast track designation, and an extra five years of market exclusivity for antibiotic development. Like rare diseases and antibiotics, addiction is a market that requires additional incentives to function effectively.</p><p><strong>3. Modernize FDA standards of efficacy for substance use disorder trials</strong></p><p>A significant barrier to pharmaceutical innovation in substance use disorders is FDA efficacy standards for substance use disorders that are outdated or unpredictable. Efficacy expectations for substance use disorder indications have been rooted in binary measures, like abstinence, that the scientific and medical community have moved past when evaluating substance use disorder harms.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6676487/\">article</a> in the <em>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</em> argues that binary outcome measures like “number of heavy drinking days” underestimate the efficacy of treatments. And a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40290-024-00526-x\">recent report</a> from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) on alcohol trial endpoints recommends a shift away from abstinence-based endpoints and towards more meaningful consumption-based endpoints. The FDA should adopt this approach for alcohol, and more broadly, for all substance use disorders.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240841?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\">a recent article</a> in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>, Dr. Wilson Compton and Dr. Nora Volkow (Director of <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/\">NIDA</a>) examine the evidence that use-reduction for cannabis and other substances is clinically meaningful and important as an endpoint. They emphasize that the FDA’s insistence on abstinence as an outcome reduces industry activity to develop new medications:</p><blockquote><p>“While achieving continuous abstinence has been documented to be clinically beneficial, such an outcome is difficult to achieve or sustain and is made particularly challenging as the brain circuits involved with self-regulation and stress reactivity have been compromised by drug use. Moreover, the weakening of social and economic support systems that many people with substance use disorders face imposes further barriers to abstinence. Such a difficult-to-achieve outcome has deterred the development of new agents to treat substance use disorders.“</p></blockquote><p>For a recent example, in the Phase 2b trial of a cannabinoid receptor 1 agonist for cannabis user disorder, the FDA required a standard of efficacy of an 80% reduction in use. <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/aelis-cannabis-use-drug-flunks-phase-2b-driving-indivior-rethink-100m-option\">The trial was unsuccessful by any standard</a>, but several researchers in the field expressed frustration to us that this requirement, a reduction far beyond that required to improve a patient’s health, sends a negative signal to other companies interested in advancing effective addiction treatments.</p><p>There are signs the FDA has begun to modernize their approach. A recent joint <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02318\">NIH and FDA paper</a> on smoking cessation therapies provides updated guidance that moves in the right direction.</p><p>More broadly, the FDA should work to adopt endpoints and standards of efficacy that align with standards in other disease areas. This shift would be best achieved through new guidance or statements issued by the FDA, which would offer positive assurance to pharmaceutical companies that they have achievable paths to approval. Predictability throughout the medication development life cycle is critical for companies considering investment.</p><p>To encourage the FDA’s evolution in this direction, Congress should include statements in upcoming appropriations and authorizations that state:</p><ol><li><p>The FDA should adopt non-binary use-reduction standards of efficacy for addiction treatments that are aligned with standards for other common disorders and the FDA shall, within 12 months, report on the standards employed for substance use disorder relative to other prevalent chronic conditions and report steps to eliminate disparities in evidentiary standards and issue new guidance on the subject.</p></li><li><p>The FDA should publish clear guidance on endpoint targets across substance use disorders to support decision-making for pharmaceutical companies considering work in this field.</p></li></ol><p><strong>4. Advanced purchasing or risk sharing for candidate medicines</strong></p><p>Uncertainty around market size and payer coverage deters private sector investment in addiction medicine. The federal government should offer advanced commitments for particularly promising SUD candidate therapies to address this concern. These commitments could come in the form of formulary inclusion, advanced purchases, or minimum sales guarantees, as appropriate. The proposed <a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/4/bennet-young-bipartisan-house-colleagues-reintroduce-bipartisan-pasteur-act-to-fight-antimicrobial-resistance\">PASTEUR Act</a>, which would offer incentives in the form of subscription contracts for development of new antibiotics, could be a model here.</p><p>These commitments would only be offered for drugs in development that have a strong likelihood of transformative impact — as with FDA decisions on PRVs, minor changes within existing drug classes would not receive these kinds of guarantees. A group of (financially non conflicted) experts modeled after FDA advisory committees could be charged with developing the guidelines under which these guarantees would be extended.</p><p>As an example, suzetrigine is a new non-addictive sodium-channel painkiller that is expected to be approved by the FDA in early 2025. It has efficacy comparable to Vicodin and could <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-pain-medication-suzetrigine-prevents-pain-signals-from-reaching-brain/\">replace opioids for pain relief</a> for many situations. However, suzetrigine will arrive with a high on-patent price, and payers will generally deny coverage unless a patient has tried and failed opioids for pain. As a result, doctors will continue prescribing opioids even when they would prefer to prescribe a non-opioid option, and this will lead to new opioid use disorders. Advanced purchasing for opioid-replacing medicines like suzetrigine could provide a mechanism for offering broad access that is affordable for the government, benefits the public, does not overpay relative to value, and does not discourage medication development.</p><p>Alternatively, a prize model could provide companies with cash for achieving specified breakthroughs in addiction medicine. <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/government-incentive-prizes/\">Prizes are growing in use</a> as a mechanism for government to incentivize innovation. This might be structured as an annual $500 million pool to reward companies for bringing high-impact anti-addiction and non-addictive pain medications through to market.</p><h4><em>Public funding and strategy interventions</em></h4><p><strong>5. Increase public funding for addiction medication development</strong></p><p>The aforementioned policies are directed at a later stage in the R&D process, and designed to “pull” innovations along into commercialization faster. This has the important advantage of attracting private investment and talent. However, there is also a “push” side to the <a href=\"https://www.margaretkyle.net/PushPull.pdf\">equation</a>: the basic science of addiction needs more funding to identify good drug targets and bring them into clinical phases. Sustained federal-level investment in addiction medicine research and development will ensure that the field has a strong pipeline going forward.</p><p>Currently, the US government allocates less than approximately $700 million annually to addiction medication development — which is too low given the vast medical and social cost of addiction.</p><p>Total funding for <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/\">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> should be increased from $1.8 billion to $4 billion, and NIAAA’s budget should be increased from $600 million to $1billion. This would bring total funding for addiction research to ~$5 billion, closer to the levels of the National Cancer Institute ($7 billion) and NHLBI ($4 billion), commensurate with the level of harm that addiction inflicts and the value of intervening upstream.</p><p>The new funding should be focused specifically on acceleration of medication development, and deployed with an agile approach. For example, in addition to pursuing new approvals, funds should be used to study long-term follow-up and to track addiction therapy efficacy and downstream impacts (incarceration, employment, etc.) over multi-year periods. These impacts are rarely studied for addiction therapies but are an essential metric for public health decision-making. In number of deaths alone, substance use disorder qualifies as a problem with the urgency of heart disease or cancer. Adding in the negative externalities of addiction to others — crime, incarceration, and disrupted communities — raises that urgency further. Better data on the impact of current and future substance use disorder medicines on these downstream metrics is essential.</p><p><strong>6. Strategy-first funding orientation</strong></p><p>Current and additional federal funding for medication development must be strategically deployed. In general, federal research funding programs are designed to respond to proposals from researchers rather than to be proactive in pursuing a research question or project.</p><p>Due to the lack of pharmaceutical activity, funding agencies that focus on addiction medicine should orient towards a more active posture. That means developing and rapidly advancing high-priority research questions and offering large grants with rapid turnaround when needed. As we saw with the $350 million <a href=\"https://heal.nih.gov/research/research-to-practice/healing-communities\">HEALing Communities Study</a>, NIDA has the capacity to drive major investment towards centrally defined strategic priorities. It should do so more frequently.</p><p>By developing ongoing mechanisms and funding pools, this can become part of agencies’ workflows, with particular focus on promising medication classes and candidates. This approach will help advance the highest ROI opportunities with the ability to pivot large amounts of funding quickly into areas that show exceptional promise.</p><p><strong>7. Public-private partnerships for drug development</strong></p><p>The NIH should actively seek public-private partnerships that bring together government funding, academic expertise, and the experience of pharmaceutical companies to help bring treatments to market. Addiction could be added to the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp\">NIH Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)</a>, which works across nine other disease areas and collaborates with dozens of pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative\">Cancer Moonshot</a> and <a href=\"https://ifp.org/progress-deferred-lessons-from-mrna-vaccine-development/\">Operation Warp Speed</a> are more specific examples of public-private funding and collaboration that have accelerated medication development. This “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-021-00313-1\">strategic blueprint</a>” for antibiotic development outlines partnership approaches that can manage risks, share resources, and accelerate the pipeline. Many of these models would also work well for substance use disorder development efforts.</p><p>For example, if a pharmaceutical company has a potentially promising treatment in its portfolio but is averse to running trials on patients with opioid use disorder, it could be paired with a federal agency like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that can manage trials while providing some brand independence.</p><h4>Measuring success and costs</h4><p>How will we know if we’ve succeeded?</p><p>In terms of industry activity, a specific target is a healthy pipeline of multiple phase 3 programs underway at any given time. For the outcome of successful FDA approvals, we can use antidepressants as a benchmark, since the number of Americans with depression is around <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/505745/depression-rates-reach-new-highs.aspx\">18%</a>, similar to the roughly <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt42731/2022-nsduh-main-highlights.pdf\">17%</a> who have a substance use disorder. There are <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/depression-medicines#SSRI\">more than 30</a> in-market antidepressants, but only <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/medications-substance-use-disorders\">about seven</a> for substance use disorders. If these policies are successful in reviving the market for addiction medicine, we should hope to eventually match the range of options in the antidepressant market.</p><p>Another metric is increasing patient adoption. Substance use disorders and depression have similar prevalence, yet only 3% of people with substance use disorders take medication, 0.5% of the population. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm\">at least 13%</a> of Americans (and likely <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/express-scripts-covid-19-driving-up-use-behavioral-health-medications\">more</a>) take antidepressants — a 26x higher adoption rate than substance use disorder medications. Until we can increase the appeal and adoption of SUD medications by at least 10x, we won’t be on track to make population-level impacts.</p><p>The total cost of a legislative package for what is proposed in this plan is roughly $3 billion annually. Several of the proposals are low or no cost. Compared to the tens of billions we spend each year on the downstream costs of addiction and the <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/issue-briefs?ID=CE55E977-B473-414F-8B88-53EB55EB7C7C\">trillions</a> in annual economic costs, this plan could end up saving money on net over time.</p><h4><strong>We can’t solve addiction if we don’t try</strong></h4><p>Addiction, cancer, and heart disease are the largest drivers of death and disability for Americans (and a large portion of those cancer and heart disease deaths are caused by substance use). Heart disease and cancer have seen substantial breakthroughs in recent years, due to ongoing focus from pharmaceutical companies, paired with a sustained commitment to basic science funding in those areas. Meanwhile, addiction medication has stagnated for decades. Advancing the pace of discovery and development in addiction medicine has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives domestically, millions globally, substantially lower disability and disease burdens across societies, and reduce crime and distrust.</p><p>There may be no realistic alternative that can reduce addiction at scale: our best prior policy efforts have not delivered the breakthroughs we’ve hoped for and need. Our best path forward is through innovation.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>APPENDIX: Innovation is happening in the illicit market but not in treatment development</strong></h4><p>The core driver of the rapid increase in overdose deaths over the past 15 years has been the dramatic growth in the supply of fentanyl and the rapid decline in cost of methamphetamine. This represents a period of rapid innovation and growth in the illicit drug market at the same time that we have experienced profound stagnation in the development of medications to reduce addictive drive and consumption.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1012\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1012,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c14eee8-e0a0-4f1e-9782-7ce1553fcb63_1456x1012.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16318\">SOURCE</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Fentanyl</strong></p><p>Fentanyl is a synthetically produced opioid, made from commercially available precursors and much cheaper to produce than heroin. Fentanyl is also much stronger, making it far easier to smuggle: one can hide 8,000 doses of fentanyl inside one golf ball. Reporters at Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-supplychain/\">recently bought $3,600 worth of fentanyl precursors</a> online, enough to manufacture $3 million worth of fentanyl, to demonstrate how easy the process is.</p><p>Existing medications for opioid dependence and overdose are less effective for fentanyl than they are for heroin.

It’s everywhere, something people attribute to microplastics or obesity or seed oils, and much else, <a href=\"https://x.com/eryney_ok/status/1863319328612872418\">a claim I very recently casually contested</a> as being likely actually the result of a change in the way we measure testosterone. I will once again reiterate my claim here: <strong>I don’t think the huge drop in testosterone is the result of anything other than a change in how we measure stuff. </strong>Below is my defense of this position focused primarily on the ways measurements have likely skewed our “testosterone crisis” that everyone on X is so worried about.</p><h3>A brief note on how things are measured</h3><p>If you’ve never worked in a lab, then it’s possible that you never thought about the mechanics of what happens when your blood sample is sent in for testing. After all, when has that ever mattered? Well, it turns out it matters quite a bit, and the standards in how we practice laboratory medicine have changed substantially over the years, owing primarily to upgrades in our methodology.</p><p>I’ll skip over the history and jump right into it. For a large period of time where much of our historical data was collected on serum testosterone levels we were using a technique called the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Adapted from protein testing, this rather ingenious method (which won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalyn_Sussman_Yalow\">Rosalyn Yalow the 1977 Nobel Prize</a>) requires three parts: 1) your thing you care about measuring taken from human serum (the “cold” antigen) 2) a radiolabeled version of that thing you care about measuring (the “hot” antigen) and 3) an antibody against the antigen you care about measuring. These three things are mixed together and the hot and cold versions of the antigen compete against each other for binding to the antibody, the end readout being a ratio of the bound:unbound sum of the measurable radiolabeled hot antigen. This technique borrows from how our immune system produces antibodies that recognize and bind features of infectious agents that are bad for us to neutralize in some capacity (this part is not important to our RIA). In this case, the feature that is bad for us – the antigen – is actually just the thing we want to measure, which in the case of this article is testosterone.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png\" width=\"553\" height=\"310\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":310,\"width\":553,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff25a7fc3-32fd-4e9d-ab7d-28f4a708bafe_553x310.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Figure 2. </strong>A brief overview of how the RIA is used to measure testosterone (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-62703-179-0_2\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Simple! Where things go wrong ultimately comes down the reliability of our preparation of our parts. As we can now understand, RIA, which relies on an antibody tweaked to recognize our molecule of interest, depends heavily on the quality and specificity of the antibodies used. These antibodies aren't perfect - they can sometimes bind to molecules that are structurally similar to testosterone, like other steroid hormones. This \"cross-reactivity\" can lead to falsely elevated results – something that is not just limited to RIA but to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22825264/\">any antibody-based quantification system.</a> This has been shown to happen basically <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16704753/\">with any androgen, like DHEA</a>, using this method, making the old results oftentimes inflated.</p><p>Second, though less critical, comes down to the fundamental premise that the competition between the label and unlabeled testosterone is equal or unbiased. The radioactive label itself can sometimes affect how the molecule binds to the antibody, creating subtle biases in the measurements. Plus, testosterone in blood doesn't travel alone - it's mostly bound to proteins. Different labs might handle these binding proteins differently during sample preparation, leading to inconsistent results between facilities.</p><p>This brings us to our third, and perhaps most important, contextual point to understand where the 1970s-90s RIA data goes wrong – the matter of standardization. The critical weakness of RIA lies in its dependence on lab-prepared components and relative measurements. Each lab would prepare their own radioactive testosterone, generate their own antibodies, and establish their own reference standards. Because the actual measurement is relative – comparing unknown samples to a lab-prepared standard – any errors in these components cascade into the final result. If a lab's standard testosterone preparation is off by 10%, all measurements from that lab will be off by 10%. With no rigorous quality control between facilities to ensure standards were equivalent, this created a patchwork of methodologies where accuracy was heavily dependent on each individual lab's technical expertise. In essence, historical testosterone measurements weren't absolute values, but rather estimations whose accuracy varied with each lab's procedures and technical skill.</p><p>The result? Without strict standardization between labs, and with the known issues of cross-reactivity in RIA testing, there's a strong possibility that historical testosterone measurements were artificially inflated. When antibodies cross-react with similar molecules, they can register \"ghost\" signals that get counted as testosterone even when they're not. This means that studies from the RIA era might be systematically overestimating testosterone levels. As labs transitioned to more specific and accurate testing methods like mass spectrometry, these \"ghost\" signals disappeared, potentially explaining some of the apparent \"decline\" in testosterone levels over time. This is actually replicated when we compare the results of the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1078143922001028?via%3Dihub\">old RIA or CLIA tests to modern day chromatography testing</a>. I’ll just leave us with this quote here from the study linked, which you can read more of if you like:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>There is significant variability in T measured with RIA, CLIA and MS. CLIA and RIA overestimated T levels in majority of patients leaving a concern of misdiagnosing truly castrate patients as being inadequately treated.”</em></p></blockquote><p>All of this is to say that RIA was great for a time, but was not a true, ungrounded measurement of what was happening because it ultimately relied on the use of a standard that can sway measurement, and picked up things that were not testosterone in the tally. What we really want is something that gives an absolute quantification of molecules in a given volume. Good news is that we have that now – welcome to the era of LC/MS!</p><h3>How we measure stuff today, and why it’s better</h3><p>Some experts (<em>cough</em> my colleague <a href=\"https://x.com/mu_anand\">Anand Muthusamy</a> <em>cough</em>) <a href=\"https://x.com/mu_anand/status/1863336271667704051\">have pointed out</a> that we measure stuff in a different way now, which is true! But if you don’t understand how this method differs you wouldn’t be faulted for simply assuming it’s just a better version of the old way. Actually, the way things are done now is much, much better because we are measuring the absolute number of testosterone molecules in a human serum sample for the volume provided, as opposed to extrapolating from a reference range. You can now buy a machine, put your sample in, and simply get a result that is exact.</p><p>Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) quickly became the way labs preferred to measure testosterone, and for good reason. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24960363/\">Many studies</a> have shown that these <a href=\"https://www.annlabmed.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.3343%2Falm.2023.43.1.19\">methods have lower limits of detection and wider linearity ranges compared to immunoassays</a>, making them more reliable, especially at low testosterone levels.

Think of it like a very sophisticated filter that sorts molecules by their size and how they interact with the filtering material. This separation step is crucial because it helps isolate testosterone from other similar molecules that might interfere with measurement.</p><p>Second, we have the \"MS\" part – mass spectrometry – where the magic really happens. Mass spectrometry is essentially a molecular scale and counting machine. It converts testosterone molecules into charged particles (ions) and then measures both their mass and quantity. The mass measurement is incredibly precise – it can distinguish testosterone from any other molecule based on its exact molecular weight and fragmentation pattern. This means that does NOT fall for the bait that immunoassays like RIA do, where similar looking things are potentially tallied because antibodies are, as we call it in the business, promiscuous.</p><p>When I say LC/MS gives us \"absolute\" numbers, here's what I mean: the machine is literally counting individual testosterone molecules that match this exact molecular fingerprint. There's no indirect measurement, no antibody binding, no relative comparison to a standard that might be off. If the machine counts 1000 testosterone molecules in your sample, that's exactly what was there. You then just multiply that by volume to adjust for your weight or whatever, and the end readout is exactly the number of circulating testosterone molecules in your body – no extrapolation needed. This is fundamentally different from RIA, where we were essentially making an educated guess based on how much radioactive testosterone got displaced from antibodies.</p><p>This direct counting ability, powered by precise molecular identification, is why LC/MS has become the gold standard. It's not just a better version of the old way – it's a completely different approach that gives us true, absolute measurements of testosterone levels. Again, this is recent technology! It didn’t exist in 1970, or 1990 – the supposed golden years of testosterone. Because these instruments are expensive, their rollout has taken time to acquire and train, leading to some years of mixed use before what has likely become the global adoption we see today (ie the “crater” decade from 2003-2011 from <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><h3>Final thoughts on why the measurement matters</h3><p>Plenty of people in my replies have pointed out other markers for, like, low sperm count or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LucasFromTheMD/status/1863649741122289913\">taint size</a> (no comment), and that’s possible! I really just want to address the primary claim that we’ve seen a meteoric crash in our testosterone levels by up to 30% as seen in the Xeet (tweet?) I responded to, because I actually think the details in the technological progress we see around us also extends to the way we quantified stuff in the past. My argument is not that things are happening to virilize or feminize us (which I’m kind of also dubious about but again, not getting into it), it’s really that I just don’t think that’s the <em>primary </em>feature we’re observing when we compare the modern testosterone count to that of the old days. What I actually think is going on, and I think is proven by the mechanics of our tests, is that the numbers back then were just inflated, that’s all. Progress doesn’t just give us iPhones, it also gives us better measurement tools! Examining the mechanics shows this to be the likely causative agent in our panic of low T, and if this is true for testosterone, I’d love to see what folks uncover about other things that are supposedly way higher or lower than in the past.</p><p>I mean, who is to say that the global taint ruler is not actually just different than it was in the past? Maybe our ruler making just got better 🙂</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

Maybe you learned this at a trivia night with friends, or by <a href=\"https://www.alumni.ox.ac.uk/article/history-made-oxford-malaria-vaccine-deployed\">reading the news</a>, or from reading a<a href=\"https://isaak.net/malaria/\"> blog post</a>, but it’s something that bears repeating – <em>mosquitoes are extremely dangerous. </em>They are likely the largest driver of death and human disease in recorded history, estimated to have caused upwards of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/0735235791\">52 billion deaths globally</a>, because of their propensity to carry viruses and parasites that make humans very ill. Even today they account for over half a million deaths from malaria globally annually, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases\">with another 250 million contracting the disease</a>. When accounting for the full spectrum of vector-borne diseases, nearly 4 billion people live in areas where they are at risk of contracting dengue fever. Though we mostly think of mosquitoes as a harbinger of plagues that affect only the developing world, superpowers like America were home to diseases like malaria and dengue fever no less than 80 years ago, when we decided to undertake massive eradication efforts that are out of fashion in the modern world. Mosquitoes are a problem for humans, and have been for much longer than recorded history.

Scientists, primarily <a href=\"https://www.science.org.au/support/analysis/reports/synthetic-gene-drives-australia-implications-emerging-technologies/gene\">Christopher Curtis</a>, proposed the idea of driving selfish, anti-pathogenic genes into wild populations of mosquitoes with the hope of rendering them inert. Much fascinating and important work has been done exploring that topic by a number of incredible scientists like <a href=\"https://targetmalaria.org/virtual-press-room/spokespeople/austin-burt/\">Austin Burt</a>, but the idea of editing mosquitoes achieved renewed vigor in 2014 when my former colleagues <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asmidler\">Andie Smidler</a>, Kevin Esvelt, Flaminia Catteruccia and George Church proposed the concept of <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/03401.pdf\">using CRISPR/Cas9 systems to create evolutionarily stable gene drives</a>. Before we talk about gene drives, it’s worth visiting some basics about mosquitoes that are underappreciated but highly relevant for a successful gene drive effort. I will focus mostly on the adult mosquito, though mosquitoes go through many stages, and it’s worth noting a relatively small (<a href=\"https://www.nemassmosquito.org/mosquitos/pages/mosquito-life-cycle\">1-5%</a>) percent of mosquitoes make it from eggs to adults (<strong>Figure 2)</strong>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"439\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":439,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e7fd98-c010-4559-ad7f-14611c45374f_1600x482.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Figure 3. </strong>Mating swarm showcasing nighttime meetup of thousands of mosquitoes hoping for their one shot at ensuring their lasting legacy through reproduction (Source: William Robert Shaw, HHMI Staff Scientist at Harvard University)</figcaption></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>There are over 3000 species of mosquito. </strong>Gene drives work by using nucleotide-specific guide RNAs to create desired edits in mosquitoes. There is enough variability between mosquito species such that 1 SNP can render a drive construct broken. <em>This means that a single identical gene drive construct will not work for every mosquito species.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Female mosquitoes mate only one time in their entire life. </strong>Once a female mosquito reaches maturity, they will engage in swarm mating (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), where they select one male mate who acts as their lifelong sperm donor. This male can go on to mate with other females, but the female is set with that male’s sperm for life – all of her progeny will be the result of his sperm. <em>One edited male mosquito mating with one female can result in thousands of off-spring carrying (gene-drive) mutations</em>. Particularly useful for population suppression (discussed more later).</p></li><li><p><strong>Female mosquitoes carry diseases. </strong>Blood meals are taken only by female mosquitoes in order to develop eggs, and are taken by a female when some internal biological trigger signals that it’s time to produce more offspring.

It contains two key components: the CRISPR machinery (Cas9) that can cut DNA, and a guide RNA that tells it exactly where to cut. When a mosquito carrying a gene drive mates with a wild mosquito, something fascinating happens in their offspring. The drive locates the natural version of its target gene on the chromosome inherited from the wild parent, cuts it, and forces the cell to repair the cut by copying over the drive-containing version. This only happens because the gRNA is specific to the gene we want to excise.</p><p>This means that instead of 50% of offspring inheriting the gene drive, nearly 100% do. Each generation, the number of mosquitoes carrying the drive doubles compared to normal inheritance. This exponential spread is what makes gene drives so powerful - and so concerning to many scientists.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png\" width=\"680\" height=\"226.32835820895522\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":446,\"width\":1340,\"resizeWidth\":680,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc3cf101-bd20-4eb9-bc6f-b61d5bdb414c_1340x446.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Figure 6a and 6b. </strong>(Left, 6a) Allelic spread through a mosquito population where the goal is population replacement.

This is where the real power of gene drives for disease control comes in. In theory, you could release a small number of engineered mosquitoes and have the desired trait spread through the entire population within a few generations. Cargo selection matters in this case, but I mostly won’t talk about that in this piece. Just know that there are a number of groups working on this – <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10795774/\">their ideas range quite a bit</a>, but some of my favorites include generation of anti-malarial peptides or porting over cytoplasmic incompatibility genes from <em>Wolbachia</em>-infected mosquito populations (<strong>Figure 6a</strong>). Some models, including one I’ve worked on, are towards population suppression drives whereby the goal is to nuke the population of mosquitoes in an area by creating sterile males. Because female mosquitoes only mate one time, a mating event between a sterile male and a wild-type female will result in a female mosquito being unable to ever produce viable offspring, which, when done at scale, can severely bottleneck a population – something that is good for vector control (<strong>Figure 6b</strong>). There are issues with that approach, because some scientists argue mosquitoes play an important role in various ecosystems, but these are not the core problems I want to address in this piece. What is worth noting is that continuous releases, generally seasonally, of sterile males or females is required to maintain the suppression of the population. Since we can’t drop the population to 0 entirely, an injection is required to keep up the effect. If you want to talk more about the tradeoffs of each approach, you can email me.</p><h3>Endonuclease action, decomposed</h3><p>At the heart of modern gene drives is the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The commonly cited (current) version of gene drive constructs has two key parts: Cas9, which is the \"scissors\" that cuts DNA, and guide RNA (gRNA), which is the \"targeting system\" that tells Cas9 exactly where to cut. Think of it like a heat-seeking missile: the guide RNA seeks out a specific DNA sequence, and once it finds it, Cas9 moves in to make the cut. A promoter is used to endogenously express this construct, leading to cuts at desired sites throughout germ cells. WIth mosquitoes, we produce this construct in one plasmid (Golden Gate works great for this, in my experience, since the constructs end up being 5+ components), then directly inject it into embryos. Though many embryos die, it works fairly well to get a starting parental population – my last experiment doing this resulted in 125 hatched larvae from 4125 injections (3.03% hatch rate). You can see the setup for how this is done in <strong>Figure 7a/b </strong>below.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png\" width=\"703\" height=\"406\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":406,\"width\":703,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b9c927-2553-4d5f-9911-f9216c18acf0_703x406.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Figure 7a. </strong>The setup for mosquito embryo microinjection involves lining up a few dozen mosquito eggs against a piece of wet paper on a slide and injecting them with ~3ul of dissolved plasmid (<a href=\"https://www.jove.com/t/20988/mosquito-embryo-microinjection-technique-to-deliver-exogenous-dna\">Protocol for those curious</a>, and source for the image above).

Guide RNAs are designed to match a specific 20-letter sequence of DNA bases (A, T, C, and G). When the guide RNA finds its matching sequence in the mosquito's DNA, it binds to it like a zipper coming together. This binding creates a signal that activates Cas9, which then makes a clean cut through both strands of the DNA double helix. In gene drives, we typically target sequences that are highly conserved, which generally means things that are critical for mosquito function and survival. This is crucial because even a single letter change in the target sequence can prevent the guide RNA from binding, rendering the gene drive ineffective, which brings us to our next section.</p><h3>Guide RNAs rule everything around me</h3><p>We understand now that gRNAs are a key component to gene drives, because they act as the homing system to our molecular cutlery. Making gene drives work requires a specific type of DNA repair to happen when damage happens. When we use CRISPR/Cas9 to edit genes in organisms, there are two potential events that can occur: non-homologous end-joining (bad) or template-directed repair (good). When Cas9 cuts DNA, it creates what's called a double-stranded break - imagine cutting both strands of the DNA double helix with molecular scissors. The cell recognizes this as damage and kicks into repair mode. The simple but messy solution is non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Think of it as the cell's emergency repair system - it grabs the broken ends and sticks them back together, often introducing small errors in the process. It's like trying to fix a broken rope by quickly tying the ends together - it works, but it's not pretty. For gene drives, NHEJ is bad because it can create mutations that make the target site unrecognizable to the gRNA, effectively immunizing that chromosome against future cutting attempts. Any future attempts at editing are thereby disrupted, since the guide no longer has a landing site, breaking the drive’s function. Because gene drives are designed for deployment in germline editing, these drive-breaking alleles propagate through a population should they arise – quite the opposite of the intended effect of gene drives!</p><p>What we want instead is homology-directed repair (HDR), also called template-directed repair. The cell looks for a similar DNA sequence to use as a template - and conveniently, we've provided one on the chromosome carrying our gene drive when we inject a construct into the embryo through microinjection. When HDR kicks in, it copies our gene drive sequence into the cut site, creating a perfect duplicate. This is why gene drives can spread so effectively: they turn the cell's own repair machinery into a copying system. It’s roughly estimated that a cell undergoes <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5241150/\">NHEJ about 75% of the time there is a double-stranded break</a>, with HDR capturing the rest of breaks that happen. It’s worth noting that there are specific time points where HDR becomes more common, with <a href=\"https://www.asgct.org/publications/news/march-2023/efficiency-homology-directed-repair-gene-editing\">HDR taking a lead with cells between the G2 and S transition</a>. Using a promoter to express Cas9 that functions during this G2/S time point is one way of biasing towards the more ideal repair mechanism, and it’s something that’s being actively tried with some success.</p><p>If we zoom out, more globally the issue with these gene drives is we can't fully control which repair pathway the cell chooses. Different organisms, cell types, and even life stages can favor one pathway over the other. This becomes particularly important in germline cells - the cells that will become eggs or sperm - because that's where the gene drive needs to work for successful inheritance. In mosquitoes, getting this balance right has proven to be one of the major technical hurdles in developing effective gene drives, though I’ll note that the team of Andrew Hammond, Andrea Crisanti and Tony Nolan are hard at work with <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7886172/\">smart mechanisms to improve HDR</a> using germline restricted promoters.</p><p>Considering the importance of the guide to making this all work seamlessly, another issue arises when SNPs happen. The use of multiple gRNAs helps in making sure Cas9 is only cutting exactly where we want to, but carries the double edged sword of creating more opportunity for things going awry as the result of just a couple mutations. Genetic engineers have come up with two main strategies for avoiding this, though, both of which are very clever: 1) they insert drive constructs in regions that become lethal to developing embryos if mutated and 2) select these regions of high importance with the hope that SNPs are less common. I’m happy to report that at least in <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/10/21/2024.10.21.618489.full.pdf\">cage experiments, the field has seen an impressive ability to create drive-resistant</a> – or even better, drive-deleting – alleles with robust engineering strategies.</p><p>Everything to this point suggests things have been going very well, a feat owed to the work of a bunch of incredible scientists doing really painful work rearing, editing, and breeding mosquitoes, often with their own blood sacrifice. But my skepticism is born out of something a little less grounded in facts, and more on vibes. Let me try to explain.</p><h3>Evolution doesn’t like us messing with things</h3><p>The below section is a little more hand-wavy, but it touches on why I believe – <em>purely from vibe / intuition</em> – that gene drives will be very difficult to make work at sufficient scale to matter, or at least compared to other things. Please understand this is really just my taste, developed through working on this problem for only a couple years, and also my experience that engineering complex systems is extremely difficult. Messing with biology is just really hard, and it often fights back.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unlike </strong><em><strong>Drosophila, </strong></em><strong>mosquitoes are not a “solved” organism</strong><em><strong>. </strong></em>Biologists use <em>Drosophila </em>to study many important features of genetics, aided by the fact that fly biology is well documented with many great tools developed for their study. Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist for mosquitoes. The field’s best database, Vectorbase, actually was under threat of going down earlier this year, but was saved <a href=\"https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/about.html\">by a group of non-profit funders </a>and is still operational (at least as of writing).</p></li></ul><p>This is a really, really important point. Some iterations of gene drives have been demonstrated to work in fruit flies, making use of a hundred years of intensive research effort, but mosquitoes unfortunately are not flies, and as such, remain shrouded in (some) mystery. Entomologists didn’t have a<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1258522\"> full </a><em><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1258522\">Anopheles </a></em><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1258522\">genome until 2014</a> – something available to anyone studying <em><a href=\"https://www.hhmi.org/news/drosophila-genome-sequence-completed\">Drosophila melanogaster </a></em><a href=\"https://www.hhmi.org/news/drosophila-genome-sequence-completed\">in 2000</a>! More generally, this is emblematic of something I hope every reader will take away, which is that <em>mosquitoes are very complicated and we do not fully understand them. </em>What I mean by this is that many of the things we take for granted in other fields are not available to mosquito biologists, and though they do tremendous things with the tools available to them, there are limitations.</p><p>Take as an example, the question of <a href=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2019/mosquitoes-show-high-resistance-to-common-insecticide/\">insecticide resistance</a>. An unfortunate consequence of permethrin and other insecticides for malaria control is that the organism has selected for individual mosquitoes that stay alive when challenged by these chemicals. This happens in many other cases, like bacteria outstripping antibiotics at a speed greater than we can produce more, but unlike bacteria, we actually didn’t quite understand this process until recently. As it turns out, the mating dance the mosquitoes do in mating swarms involve tapping/testing the cuticle thickness of males to determine fitness, which, it turns out, is the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02434-1\">exact feature that makes mosquitoes resistant to insecticides</a>. I’m sure some readers will think of some way to engineer around this, but it seems likely some other obstacle will become a hurdle. See the below for what I’m talking about.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Being infected with malaria parasites has no fitness cost to the female mosquito. </strong>The major challenge to our ability to do anything in biology often comes down to how much nature resists us. In this case, there are challenges presented by the fact that <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008908\">malaria-infected mosquitoes do not have any fecundity deficits.</a> Some labs have even reported that <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4387490/\">malaria infection actually drives mosquitoes to oviposit</a> earlier (mosquito version of giving birth).</p></li></ul><p>Evolution is complicated, and the mechanisms that have gotten enduring species to this point are robust, with a significant amount of redundancy to capture the best and most important features. In the case described above, mosquitoes are seeing some types of fecundity / fertility benefits from being infected with <em>Plasmodium </em>parasites. In another case we see that the most insecticide resistant mosquitoes – which we established earlier are the result of thicker, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011448\">fitter thorax/abdomen selected for in mating – actually promotes </a><em><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011448\">Plasmodium </a></em><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011448\">infection</a> in the mosquito. What I’m getting at with these obscure references to basic mosquito biology is that things are complicated, and what may seem obvious with rational approaches can cause us issues that are not clear until much later.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Nations deserve some amount of independence here. </strong>Now, I understand this isn’t a scientific or engineering point, but I want to cover it regardless. A common argument I hear from people (or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/opinion/malaria-genetics-disease.html\">read in the NYTimes</a>) is that gene drives work, and we just need to start testing them in the wild to demonstrate that. It may be true that drives work in cage experiments quite well, but we’re generally making this argument with the hope of testing these in <em>someone else’s backyard</em>. Gene drives are mostly discussed for release in malaria endemic areas, not managing West Nile or EEE outside of Boston, or Zika in Florida. I believe in autonomy, and think giving independent, albeit resource-limited nations a chance to dictate their own fate is worthwhile and important, even if we strongly believe our technology will work. It’s ultimately them who will have to live with the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6378608/\">consequences of affected ecological niches</a>, or pay a bunch of money for continuous releases if evolutionary stable drives don’t pan out. I mention this in the spirit of self-governance, but I’m sure there are nations that want to try this, and to them I say go for it — the global community would be in your debt if you elected to do so.</p></li></ul><h3>Some last points</h3><p>I truly hope the scientific community can solve the malaria problem, and I firmly believe it will happen. What I’m hoping to impart on the readers here is not a pessimism for what we can accomplish with biological engineering, but rather offer my opinion about why things haven’t worked out to this point, and more importantly, why it’s worth exploring other options to conquering these pests.</p><p>To that end, I’m happy to say that there are other very clever things biologists have come up with. I will list just a couple of them here, and why I’m hopeful.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Infecting malaria-carrying mosquitoes with </strong><em><strong>Wolbachia </strong></em><strong>bacteria. </strong>It turns out that there’s an incredible symbiotic relationship that exists between certain types of non-malaria carrying mosquitoes, <em>Culex</em> species, and an obligate intracellular bacteria <em>Wolbachia. </em>When infected, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6237385/\">mosquitoes become incapable of carrying viruses</a> that cause Dengue, West Nile and Zika, and more, as recently discovered, malaria. The genes involved in this process, cifA and cifB, when transferred to mosquitoes <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00998-6\">results in conditional sterility</a> – a potential other tool for malaria control. Some groups are working to transfer these <em>Culex</em>-infecting <em>Wolbachia </em>bacteria to malaria-carrying <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes with the hopes of breaking the capability of Anophelines to be disease vectors. This seems exciting, mostly because this is something that occurs in nature, and more importantly, is easily reversible with antibiotic treatment if something goes wrong.</p><ul><li><p>Though this is one bullet point, consider it two separate concepts – engineering mosquitoes to carry cifA/B, or infecting mosquitoes with <em>Wolbachia. </em><a href=\"https://www.oxitec.com/en/our-technology\">Oxitec</a> is working on <em>Wolbachia </em>as an approach to genetically modifying mosquitoes sustainably, and are doing releases now.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Treating mosquito nets with human malaria drugs. </strong>My former colleagues at Harvard, namely Doug Paton (who runs <a href=\"https://vet.uga.edu/person/douglas-paton-2/\">his own lab at the University of Georgia</a>), came up with the genius idea of <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6438179/\">soaking mosquito nets in the malaria drug atovoquone</a>. It turns out this works very well at ridding the mosquito of the malaria parasite. Resistance is always a concern with these types of approaches, but it is incredible that this works at all – my expectation is that little tricks like this can add up to big gains, when combined with existing mosquito net and insecticide paint treatment in houses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional malaria vaccines seem to be well underway. </strong>Technologies successfully deployed in the COVID era have great potential to unlock a functional malaria vaccine. There is exciting work coming out of both <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00783-y\">academic</a> and <a href=\"https://cepi.net/biontech-and-cepi-expand-partnership-strengthen-africas-mrna-vaccine-ecosystem\">industry</a> groups, and there is reason to be hopeful.</p></li></ul><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>There is a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future of malaria control coming in from many different directions. It is a terrible disease that has killed more people than any other infection on the planet, and of course people will always get excited about new approaches to handling difficult problems. Gene drives are exciting for scientists and laymen alike, because it’s an application of human ingenuity to solve the problems caused by forces outside of our control – something I very much believe in. But being chained to continuous releases is a considerable obstacle, and it’s worth considering whether this is better than existing alternatives, like more investment in nets, eliminating standing water in living areas, and development of vaccines. I just think ultimately there are other exciting approaches worth exploring, and would hate to see the enthusiasm to solve such a significant challenge dwindle due to the difficulty of deploying gene drives in the world.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1063\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1063,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b442ebc-9a08-41a2-9609-0be0ec099c43_1600x1168.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A generous donation from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/mosquitoes-researchers-feeding-blood/2020/08/21/25f30252-c608-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html\">Perran Ross, PhD</a> — a common practice in mosquito research.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Come on, can you please read the post?

But, before I do that, I just want to applaud Nat for this effort. Nat organized a big, expensive effort to do science in the public interest, contributing a fair amount of his own time and money to do something he considered valuable. I think that’s incredibly cool, and, frankly, an inspiration for me.</p><p>Ok, enough plaudits. Let’s dig into it.</p><h2>Brief overview of the report</h2><p>The PlasticList is a 300 item list of foods and some consumer items. These range from tap water, to grocery store steaks, to fast-food hamburgers, to tampons. Each of these items was obtained from somewhere in the Bay Area, blended up, and analyzed for plasticizers, which are chemicals used in the making of different sorts of plastic.</p><p>Most of the plasticizers that these items were analyzed for have some evidence of negative health consequences. A few of the plasticizers do not. The items were not checked for anything else (e.g. actual plastics or heavy metals). Most items had replicates, meaning that multiple of the same item were tested (i.e. multiple Fiji water bottles).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"720\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":720,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":258100,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":true,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F603080dc-68a5-4c73-98ce-56ce47b3a4d6_2679x1324.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A link to <a href=\"https://www.plasticlist.org/\">the PlasticList itself</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The methodology, which I’ll get into later, was ok but not amazing. So, assume all of my conclusions are with a low degree of confidence. Anything I state should be assumed to be a call for replication and future investigation, not a definitive claim.</p><h2>Interesting findings</h2><p><strong>1. The water, both tap and bottled, is generally good</strong>. I, like many of you, drink a lot of water. Water contamination would be bad. Fortunately, the water quality, both tap and non-tap, generally seems pretty good.</p><p>There are a few worrying signals, such as one crazy high DEHT signal from the tap water Fort Mason, a neighborhood in San Francisco, but that one didn’t seem to replicate. The only one that I think I’d be confident that is probably bad is the tap water from Hayes Valley, which consistently shows a high DEHT signal.</p><p>2. <strong>Seafood, steak, and chicken are all bad.</strong> Nat’s team tested 3 different varieties of Whole Foods salmon (smoked, farm raised, and wild caught) and one variety of canned tuna. All seafood tested had worryingly high levels of plasticizers, with the canned tuna being especially bad for BPA and the Whole Foods salmon being especially bad for DEHT.</p><p>Similarly, all steak and chicken tested, both from the local butcher and from Whole Foods, was bad for plasticizers. Organic steak and chicken was no exception.</p><p><strong>3. Vegetables have low levels of plasticizers. </strong>While Whole Foods vegetables were the only vegetables tested, all vegetables tested had some level of plasticizers. Lettuce was the worst of the bunch (no pun intended).</p><p><strong>4. Almost all beverages that come from a store in a plastic or plastic-y paper cup were bad, whether cold or hot</strong>. <strong>Metal and glass were ok</strong>. Iced coffee, hot coffee, milkshakes, and Gatorade were all bad for various sorts of plasticizers. Flexible plastic cups for cold drinks (i.e. the ones used for bubble tea) seemed to be the worst of the bunch. Metal and glass containers generally got off ok.</p><p><strong>5. Fast food is bad, regardless of what you get</strong>. Unsurprisingly given the above, all fast food hamburgers, salads (including Sweetgreen), and drinks were bad for plasticizers.</p><p><strong>6. Takeout containers don’t make an obvious difference. </strong>Indian food at the restaurant had sometimes higher levels of plasticizers than takeout Indian and sometimes lower.</p><p><strong>7. Microwaving reduces plasticizers. </strong>One very consistent signal is that the plasticizers in prepared foods <em>decreased</em> after microwaving. This happened across foods and across plasticizers.</p><h2>Tentative conclusions</h2><p><strong>1. Plasticizers accumulate up the food chain</strong>. Water occasionally has plasticizers. Vegetables always have a low level of plasticizers. Meat, including chicken, steak, and fish, always has a high level of plasticizers. This suggests accumulation.</p><p><strong>2. Heating often destroys plasticizers</strong>. Microwaving seems to destroy plasticizers. Letting takeout food cool down or leaving water bottles in the sun doesn’t seem to reliably increase plasticizers.</p><p><strong>3. Plasticizers leach from polypropylene and LDPE. </strong>The worst offenders for plastic bottles seem to all be polypropylene bottles, such as the Starbucks cups. Paper cups lined with low density polyethylene also seem bad. Polyethylene terephthalate, which is what disposable water bottles are made of, do not seem to leach plasticizers as much.</p><p><strong>4. BPA is still a problem, although less so than in the past. </strong>People have been talking about the dangers of BPA for decades. Somehow, Boba Guys still has significant amounts of it.</p><h2>Caveats and compliments about the PlasticList methodology</h2><p>The PlasticList team clearly put in a lot of time and effort into making this the best project that they could. There’s a lot I like about what they did, and they’ve definitely provided me with some food (and plasticizers) for thought. I’ll put a list of what I liked below.</p><p>However, I have two big complaints about this piece, and a bunch of little ones.</p><h3>PlasticList should have engaged better with the prior literature</h3><p>As I wrote in my piece 7 months ago, other people have done similar reports to this one, showing that various food items have plasticizers in them. Nat’s team didn’t really build off of that work, and instead tested a bunch of random items.</p><p>As a result, a lot of the team’s work can be summarized as “many of the food items and some of the consumer items in the Bay Area have plasticizers in them”, which is exactly what I predicted their work would turn out to be 7 months ago. I would have much preferred them to try to explain, support, or refute prior literature, especially given the $500k (which is a lot!) at their disposal.</p><p>Engaging with the prior literature would have also helped them avoid my second major complaint, which is…</p><h3>PlasticList’s testing should have been hypothesis-driven</h3><p>Testing 300 items for 18 different plasticizers produces a lot of data. Unfortunately, as any good scientist can tell you, a lot of data means a lot of noise. Some of that noise is interesting, like sudden spikes in plasticizers from one water sample to the next or high levels of plasticizers in Whole Foods salmon.</p><p>If the PlasticList had followed up on that, like testing those water samples repeatedly to see if there are any time-related patterns in when plasticizers spike or testing salmon from multiple different grocery stores, we could make strong conclusions from that data. As it is, all I can say is “sometimes Bay Area tap water might have high level of plasticizers” or “Bay Area Whole Foods salmon might have high levels of plasticizers depending on the store or time of year”, which are not strong conclusions.</p><h3>Assorted complaints</h3><p>1. They needed more replications per item, especially when the item had very high levels of plasticizers. Some items, like the Chipotle Burrito, were only tested once.</p><p>2. They needed more samples per purchased item. As far as I can tell, their replications were done by purchasing another of that item (i.e. another Coke can), but never done twice on the same purchased product. This leaves open the possibility of instrumental error.</p><p>3. They needed a better protocol for testing parts of complex items. All items were blended before testing, which makes it impossible to tell where the plasticizers are located in say, a hamburger.</p><p>4.

We present a conceptual framework illustrating how primary and secondary trauma exposures occur during news gathering, reporting, and consumption phases. The study also reviews empirical findings on PTSD's effects on brain structure and function, identifying symptom subclusters and their associated brain regions. This knowledge informs the development of biotypes for more personalized and effective treatment strategies for journalists with PTSD while also emphasizing an urgent need for comprehensive support systems for journalists. This interdisciplinary approach uniting research in journalism, neuroscience, psychology, and organizational management, also advances the understanding of trauma in journalism and its broader implications for news consumption and societal trust in media institutions.

Trauma is an underappreciated aspect of journalists reporting on tragic events and relaying this news to audiences (Hill, 2018). Trauma that originates from a direct source is called primary trauma, while “the spread of negative emotional and cognitive states from those who are traumatized to those who have close contact with these individuals” is known as secondary trauma and is much less appreciated, both in the journalism mental health literature as well as the PTSD literature more generally (Motta, 2023). It is important to examine the role of both primary and secondary trauma in journalism, not only in journalists but at all steps of the news cycle. Understanding PTSD in journalists and general consumers of news therefore not only requires understanding where trauma exposure occurs across the news ecosystem but also a dedicated effort to better understand causes and effects of PTSD in this population to help journalists, especially war journalists and war photojournalists, but also the audiences they serve, to have better mental health outcomes and to improve journalism as a profession.</p><p><strong>Trauma is involved in all steps in the news cycle</strong></p><p>Table 1 conceptualizes the news reporting cycle in the context of primary and secondary trauma exposure. As Table 1 demonstrates, trauma exposure can occur at all three phases of this news reporting cycle, making the case for investigating the traumatic exposure of not only journalists in reporting news but potentially, audiences consuming news content.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png\" width=\"952\" height=\"718\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":718,\"width\":952,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":132085,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":false,\"topImage\":true,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01918851-8084-48c0-873e-96a57938ef58_952x718.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The management structure for journalists, which typically has a hierarchical structure with journalists reporting to various levels of editors, creates opportunities for all involved in news production to develop secondary or even primary PTSD. A study of local journalists reporting on the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, Hill (2018) found that organizational leaders can identify trauma reactions of journalists, and may even become victims of secondary traumatic stress when journalists are assigned to cover a primary trauma such as war or terrorism. Even newsroom journalists who are not out in the field experience repeated exposure to traumatic news (Shah et al., 2020). While in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City Bombing, counseling, leadership, and social support increased for journalists, training has not changed in the nearly 30 years since the tragic event (Hill, 2018). Studying PTSD in journalism is a small community of practice, collecting more and more evidence that journalists and newsrooms face unique challenges when reporting on difficult events such as war, natural disasters, or terrorism. Furthermore, the trauma they are exposed to and report on can be further passed down the line beyond journalists and newsroom management to the communities served, as is discussed next.</p><p><strong>Studies on the neuroscience of journalism and journalist PTSD are scarce</strong></p><p>While a vast literature has documented the effects of stress and anxiety on the brain, few studies have examined the neuroscience of journalism consumption, let alone journalist PTSD, specifically. Studies on the effect of news consumption on the brain are scant but reveal news consumption’s clear effects on behavior, cognition, and decision-making and help explain why people may “doomscroll” or read “clickbait” articles (Dan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022). Researchers have also examined the role of stress in news consumption in a very limited context. A study of doomscrolling of COVID-19 news in the pandemic found that greater exposure to COVID-19 news was associated with more stress about COVID, greater depression and anxiety, and increased drug use as a coping mechanism (Dyar et al., 2024). Another study found that women exhibit greater signs of stress reactivity than men after reading bad news (Marin et al., 2012). More recently, Shabahang and colleagues (2024) discovered that doomscrolling evokes existential anxiety in both the United States and Iran.</p><p>Further work is needed to determine in what ways the neuroscience of news gathering and reporting is similar to or different from that of news consumption. Only a handful of studies have examined journalism’s effect on journalists, though the existing evidence suggests that PTSD is an underreported problem among practitioners. Jukes (2017) terms the phrase “affective journalism,” rooted in neuroscience and referring to “affective processes, behaviours and practices that lie at the heart of journalists’ work when covering traumatic news stories.” Jukes (2017) learns that wartime journalists must work to actively distance themselves from the traumatic events they are covering as a buffer from ill effects.</p><p>Feinstein et al. (2002) note that war journalism is “a hazardous profession,” with PTSD rates matching those of combat veterans, adding, “despite the risks inherent in reporting war, we could find no research on the psychological health of war reporters.” This is echoed by Marais and Stewart (2005), who suggest that journalist temperament contributes to development of PTSD. A 2023 study of East African journalists (Radoli, 2023) found that trauma visuals can contribute to escalation of journalist PTSD.</p><p>War photojournalists are particularly vulnerable to PTSD. A study of photojournalists assigned to cover traumatic events by Newman et al. (2003) revealed that those assigned to photograph a greater number of traumatic events experienced greater distress. Jonisová (2022) writes about the negative impact of war photography on photojournalists’ mental health, as it brings them closer to the primary trauma source, “risking their lives to bring us a visual testimony directly from the battlefront.”</p><p>A small, dedicated community of practice, both dedicated to training journalists better and advancing the research on trauma and journalism, is emerging to help journalists better cover such events while advancing pedagogical approaches that protect journalist mental health. This highly interdisciplinary work unites scholars in journalism training and education, neuroscience, psychology, organizational management, and more. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61560521622594\">Journalism Education and Trauma Research Group - North America</a> (n.d.), a group of researchers dedicated to understanding the role of trauma in journalists’ lives, held its first symposium, titled “On Sacred Ground,” in 2024. The <a href=\"https://dartcenter.org/\">Columbia University Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma</a> (n.d.) unites journalists and trauma researchers, including neuroscientists studying post-traumatic stress disorder, to help journalists grapple with reporting on tragic events.</p><p>This work may also provide insights into the neural underpinnings of primary and secondary trauma; empirically validate non-stereotypical traumatic experiences; and improve PTSD treatments by considering lived experiences of people not stereotypically associated with PTSD, given that trauma occurs on a spectrum, and its neurobiological effects can be observed on a spectrum as well (Stark, 2015).<strong> </strong>Studying journalist PTSD and the downstream effects of traumatic news reporting for consumers of news could also have broad social implications for our interactions with news institutions and the work of building trust with news audiences, given that links are emerging between PTSD and social dysfunction and trust (Winkeler, 2023).</p><p><strong>Empirical findings of PTSD effects on brain structure</strong></p><p>About 6-7% of the population will meet the criteria for PTSD in their lifetime, with those experiencing traumatic events most likely to develop PTSD. Individual, trauma-focused therapies are most effective to treat the disorder; those who are unable to access trauma-focused therapies can also benefit from “symptom reduction” using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Schrader and Ross, 2021). Different types of PTSD may benefit from different therapies. For example, individuals with comorbid PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD), in a randomized clinical trial of exposure therapy, benefitted more from virtual reality exposure therapy than prolonged imagined exposure when either was combined with d-cycloserine, an antibiotic used as a partial NMDA agonist to boost the effects of exposure therapy (Difede et al., 2022).</p><p>Understanding the neurobiology of PTSD and its many different combinations can help answer empirical questions and create more effective treatments, especially given the heterogeneity of PTSD and may have implications for persistence of various symptoms post treatment (Ringwald, 2024; Ringwald et al., 2024). There are 20 symptoms defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM V) which, when combined, create 636,120 unique symptom combinations (Galatzer and Levy, 2013). Common comorbidities of PTSD include anxiety and depression (Spinhoven et al., 2014) as well as a higher risk of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder (Goldstein et al., 2016). A large study in the US found that 44.6% of people living with PTSD also struggled with alcohol use disorder (AUD) or substance use disorder (Simpson et al., 2019). AUD and SUD have also been linked to specific features of the disorder, such as dissociation (Najavits and Walsh, 2012) and dysphoria, which can include hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptoms (Biehn et al., 2015). PTSD has demonstrated effects on brain function, structure, and biochemistry (Harnett et al., 2020) which are increasingly well-understood.</p><p>Trauma exposure can also create neurobiological signatures without a diagnosis of PTSD, and these signatures can vary. Table 2 (appendix—see <a href=\"https://files.theseedsofscience.org/2024/Trauma_Exposure_across_the_News_Cycle.pdf\">PDF</a>) lists symptom subclusters derived from the underlying structure of PTSD (e.g., Elklit and Shevlin, 2010; Krause, et al., 2007) which are differentially associated with different brain regions, not only in PTSD but also in cases in which trauma exposure has happened but symptoms are below the threshold for a PTSD diagnosis. This is consistent with the idea of a trauma spectrum (Stark, 2015) on which both journalists and consumers of news experience primary and secondary trauma at varying levels. While the exact functions and roles of each brain region are outside the scope of this article, it is notable that differences in brain structure exist between different subclusters of symptoms, lending evidence to the idea that symptoms of PTSD, which often overlap with those in anxiety and depression, may lead to unique neural signatures (Tozzi et al., 2024).</p><p><strong>The case for PTSD biotypes in war journalism</strong></p><p>Reflecting on the diversity of experiences in living with PTSD, and their potential neurological effects, can lead to the establishment of biotypes in which PTSD patients differ on symptoms, behavioral and cognitive performance, and response to medications and treatments (Tozzi et al., 2024). Such biotypes can help those living with PTSD obtain more tailored treatments and help them live better lives, as well as advance the science of trauma and potentially, better illuminate its role in our daily lives as consumers of news.</p><p>Journalists are trained to tell stories, so talking to journalists about their traumatic experiences may also support their posttraumatic growth by helping with the establishment of a trauma narrative (van Der Kolk, 2022). Talking to war journalists about their PTSD symptoms, treatments, and other aspects of living with PTSD can help define biotypes that can be further examined using neuroimaging to understand the full range of PTSD lived experiences with implications for treatment and recovery. War journalists are the population of journalists that are most likely to develop PTSD. Feinstein et al. (2002) found not only that war journalists and combat veterans had similar levels of PTSD, but that war journalists scored higher on depression and PTSD measures, and self-reported drinking more alcohol, compared to other journalists. Despite the risks, journalists may not be informed about emotional impacts of this work, and may have inadequate access to mental health resources such as counseling (Newman et al., 2003).</p><p>Furthermore, biotypes of PTSD may differ between people actively fighting in a combat zone and those there to report on it. For example, the locus of control may differ between combat veterans and war journalists, and research shows that those with a higher external locus of control are more likely to develop PTSD (Güzel et al., 2024). A combat veteran may have a high internal locus of control, believing that their work can improve the lived experiences of local people, as Marcus Luttrell did as a Navy Seal, as detailed in his memoir <em>Service: A Navy Seal at War </em>(Luttrell and Hornfischer, 2014). Journalists, as observers, may have different loci of control. A former Iraq war journalist I interviewed stated that he did not feel his objectives as a war journalist, on the other hand, were accomplished, and that he felt shame for being among people who did not have a choice to be in a war zone.</p><p>Lastly, biotypes may differ between war journalists themselves. In the next section, I detail the PTSD symptoms of two war journalists – both managers of a large journalistic organization in Iraq during the height of the insurgency in the Iraq War – who live with vastly different PTSD symptoms. One has greater re-experiencing symptoms, while the other has greater hyperarousal symptoms. Research shows that hyperarousal and re-experiencing have opposite effects on affective habituation, which is a phenomenon that occurs when one is repeatedly exposed to a traumatic stimulus, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. McCurry et al. (2020) looked at affective habituation in combat veterans and found that hyperarousal and re-experiencing symptoms engaged different brain circuits in affective habituation. In the study, hyperarousal symptoms linked to decreased habituation to negative stimuli in areas of frontal and temporal gyri, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. On the other hand, re-experiencing symptoms were linked to increased affective habituation towards negative stimuli in a similar set of brain regions. More research is needed to better understand PTSD biotypes, and talking to war journalists can be an important step forward towards a better understanding of the disorder.</p><p><strong>Looking to war journalists’ lived experiences for clues about PTSD biotypes</strong></p><p>“Post-traumatic stress disorder isn’t just for soldiers. After years of covering war and tragedy in the Middle East and Southeast Asia for Reuters, it happened to me,” says Dean Yates, a journalist turned workplace mental health expert and public speaker who was diagnosed with PTSD in 2016 (Yates, 2016). He describes his diagnosis as “plunging into an abyss” (Yates, 2016). “It’s hard to stop falling when you don’t understand why you fell in the first place,” he writes in his memoir, <em>Line in the Sand</em>. “After my diagnosis, I felt no emotion, nothing. I had a name for my condition, but no relief” (Yates, 2023, p. 28).</p><p>Yates spent 26 years at Reuters, serving as bureau chief in Iraq. He later served as their head of mental health strategy from 2017 to 2020. Yates is a workplace mental health expert, public speaker, podcast host and journalist. He is an outspoken advocate on mental health, press freedom and government accountability. In his book, <em>Line in the Sand, </em>he details his experiences working as Bureau chief in Iraq during the war. “As bureau chief of the largest foreign news organisation in Baghdad, I fear for the safety of my staff more than anything” (Yates, 2023, p. 4), Yates writes. Journalism staff not only died as a consequence of the wartime military operations but were also deliberately targeted by terrorists during his tenure.</p><p>All of it is just another day at work for Yates, who says of the journalists’ deaths, which he wrote a story about for Reuters: “Of course, this is news. More emails arrive asking the same question. All my foreign colleagues wait until I write a five-paragraph story before reporting the event. This makes it real, not a nightmare. Doing something I’ve done thousands of times for Reuters across Asia and the Middle East for fifteen years” (Yates, 2023, p. 11). Doing something he loves allows him to say “focused,” as he writes in his book: “More precisely, the work, the responsibility I carry, stops me falling apart” (Yates, 2023, p. 11).</p><p>Work became a survival mechanism and way of life for Yates, but the trauma eventually started to catch up with him. At one point, he asked his editors if he could leave the reporting zones to work remotely, which they accepted. Then, he began having intrusive reminders of the various events he’d experienced, forcing him to work less. “Dozens of sights and sounds began intruding into my head,” says Yates of his PTSD symptoms: “intermittent at first, frequent now” (Yates, 2023, p. 24). He also has nightmares: “Even when I’m not being pursued in my sleep, the scenes are always violent. [...] I’m in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East. People I know sometimes appear, usually journalists” (Yates, 2023, p. 41). Yates, who also reported from Banda Aceh, Indonesia, during its tragic 9.5-magnitude earthquake, continues: “I also show up in Indonesia or Australia. Then there is lots of water, flooding. I must flee or drown” (Yates, 2023, p. 41).</p><p>To deal with his symptoms, Yates says he self medicated codeine, Xanax, and alcohol, though his psychiatrist urged him to rest. “Problem is – on sick leave and therefore free of editing copy, writing emails and taking part in daily news-planning calls – my mind has declared war on itself” (Yates, 2023, p. 41). Yates describes a lack of support from Reuters, such as no “internal peer network of journalists who support distressed colleagues” (Yates, 2023, p. 42). “It’s like I don’t exist,” he writes (Yates, 2023, p. 42).</p><p>Even prior to his diagnosis, spending years covering wars and catastrophes around the world, Yates struggled with normal life. His book portrays him as sensitized to a life of chaos and trauma, drawn to “newsroom noise, the pull of a big story,” even on the occasion of the birth of his child with his partner, a fellow journalist (Yates, 2023, p. 30).</p><p>“I don’t know anyone who has worked in war zones as a journalist who has not been damaged by it,” says<strong> </strong>a war journalist to whom I spoke that preceded Yates as Reuters Baghdad Bureau chief. However, his symptoms, as he describes them in his own words, are a bit different. While Yates struggles with reexperiencing symptoms, his anonymous colleague was diagnosed with both PTSD and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Luderer et al. (2020) found that ADHD was associated with a higher risk for traumatic events, self-reported PTSD, and higher severity of PTSD patients with alcohol dependence.</p><p>The anonymous bureau chief developed substance abuse problems, especially with alcohol, when he began self-medicating to help his brain stop “racing around” and “as a way to focus.”</p><p>“In a way, it worked, at first, because I was able to calm my brain and write much better for a while, but because I was using increasing amounts of alcohol, it escalated, and then I was going through withdrawal. I wasn’t drinking to write, I was drinking to not go through withdrawal,” he says. He was able to stop drinking, and realized that he could never drink again because it would put him back into the same cycle.</p><p>His PTSD is, in his words, “a little bit complex because I’ve been in personal danger a whole bunch of times. I’ve been in a helicopter that was shot down, I’ve been bombed, I’ve been shot at, but as far as I know, none of those incidents really traumatized me, and I don’t think they caused me any harm. What I think caused me the harm was that…I was in charge of all journalists in the Middle East which included Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, all these war zones and the constant stress of that, I think, kind of wore me down.”</p><p>Dangers journalists face in warzones both relate to their own survival and that of their colleagues. While the unnamed war journalist woke up to the sound of bombs daily, he “just kind of got used to it…you just kind of learn to ignore it.” What he cites as contributing to his PTSD is having to account for others in the warzone. Because terrorist groups in the region targeted foreign journalists, the Bureau had to work with local Iraqi journalists to do reporting.</p><p>“All day I'd be just on edge just worrying about them and worrying about their safety, and I only ever really relaxed about 11 pm at night, when I knew all the cars were back safely. And I could kinda relax. And this went on for two years. And so I think part of you know, the damage that was done to me is mainly just this attritional tension and stress, day after day, not really worrying about myself, but worrying about other people. So I think that kind of wore me down,” he says. He and Yates were also affected when two of their colleagues were killed by a United States military helicopter, the details of which were released by Wikileaks. Eventually, the anonymous journalist says, he got to a point where, when he would hear loud bombs in the middle of the night, he would just go back to sleep. He notes that his colleagues did, too. “That was kind of a sign for me that I’d crossed a line into a different kind of thinking, where I can be bombed and just go back to bed and think it’s normal,” he said.</p><p>A few aspects of PTSD in journalism are “a bit different and interesting” to the anonymous war journalist: <br><br>(1) <strong>Most journalists will never want to say they have PTSD and are ashamed about it because they volunteered to go to the war zone.</strong> When war journalists go into a war zone, it is by choice, and often they have fought hard to get there “because it’s good for your career,” he says.</p><p>(2) <strong>“You’re reporting on people who don’t have a choice. They are stuck there.”</strong> The people living in warzones did not get to choose to be there or not, says the war journalist. However, journalists can call their editor at any time and quit. “That creates a sense of shame, I think, for journalists when they are affected by PTSD. You feel like, ‘Oh, what right do I have to have become ill from this?’ Other people who have no choices are having to go on with their lives. So that’s one reason journalists deny [that they have PTSD].”</p><p>(3) <strong>Vicarious trauma can play a large role.</strong> The unnamed war journalist said that the most damaging thing for his mental health was seeing his colleagues go into danger. He was not as worried about himself and didn’t himself face any real danger, but found “just seeing the awful consequences for others” damaging.</p><p>(4) <strong>Related to PTSD is the idea of “moral injury”</strong> which the National Center for PTSD (n.d.) describes as “distressing psychological, behavioral, social, and sometimes spiritual aftermath of exposure to such events.” The unnamed war journalist describes it as “a disease of your soul” in which the things you see that are “morally indefensible … can make you a bit unwell. It’s part of the whole story,” he says. He relates a quote from <em>Dispatches </em>by war journalist Michael Herr: “What I didn't know, and it took the war to teach me, was that you're not only responsible for the things that you do. You're also responsible for the things that you see.’” When you witness events in a war zone, he says, even if “you didn't cause it, and it wasn't your fault, you do feel a sense of moral responsibility, and it does harm your mental health.”</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Journalism exposes its practitioners and consumers alike – especially on issues such as wars, disasters, and terrorist events – to trauma. Research shows that journalists, especially wartime journalists, including photographers, face PTSD rates similar to combat veterans. Despite this, there is a critical lack of mental health support and resources for wartime journalists and their newsrooms. Research on the neuroscience of journalism and journalist PTSD is limited, despite extensive literature documenting stress and anxiety’s effects on the brain in other contexts. The few available studies paint a picture of traumatic news coverage that leads to adverse behavioral and cognitive outcomes not only in journalists but in consumers of news as well.</p><p>Because journalists are natural storytellers, looking at their experiences can also help develop biotypes of PTSD which may differ in terms of symptoms, treatments, and neurobiological substrates. Empirical findings on the neurobiology of PTSD provide a basis for developing better treatments based on such biotypes. One step forward towards a biotype may involve identifying symptom subclusters and looking at the brain regions associated with them to gain insight into PTSD’s underlying neural mechanisms. This knowledge, combined with individual symptom profiles and treatment responses, can inform the development of biotypes for more personalized interventions, helping not only journalists but all people living with PTSD.</p><p>Understanding the neurobiology of PTSD in journalists is crucial for developing tailored treatments and support systems, ultimately improving both journalist well-being and the quality of news reporting. War journalists’ experiences underscore the urgent need for comprehensive support systems throughout the news ecosystem. By recognizing journalists' unique challenges and leveraging neuroscience and psychology insights, scientists and clinicians can develop more effective interventions, and the pedagogy of journalism can be improved to support mental health capacity-building in the newsroom. This approach can enhance news reporting quality and contribute to a more resilient society.</p><h3><strong>Gardener Comments</strong></h3><p><strong>Andrew Neff (Ph.D. Neuroscience):</strong><br>I can see value in replacing DSM diagnostic categories & generic symptoms with more specific symptoms & symptom-clusters that were defined with feedback from people with lived experience. New sub-categories of PTSD could inspire the development of new psychotherapies or social interventions, and incorporating new symptoms checklists could be built into machine learning models to better predict individualized treatment response (likely alongside fMRI and other measures). To be convinced of the value of this approach, you need to accurately predict treatment response, but also need to create a system that increases the total number of people treated.</p><p>The one thing I don’t think will work out is using neuroimaging to identify biological intervention targets, insofar as 1) fMRI voxels are ambiguous summaries of ~10,000+ neurons, and 2) non-invasive stimulation technology is even less precise and generally unable to target more than one region at a time. Even if we had better interventional tech (like surgically implanted electrodes), of the brain’s infinite properties, I am doubtful that manipulating fMRI voxels is a powerful and specific lever, and historically we haven’t had many (...any) successes with this approach.</p><p><strong>Ben Curtis (Photojournalist, Nieman Fellow):</strong></p><p>This article provides a broad look at the latest research into the role of traumatization in news reporting and photojournalism and aspects of the neuroscience involved, making the case for treating trauma experienced through such work, especially conflict reporting, as a specific biotype of symptoms and causation.</p><p>Despite the high prevalence of PTSD in these individuals there is a relative paucity (with some notable exceptions) of research specific to them, and so this article is very welcome.</p><p><strong>George (psychologist):<br></strong>This is perhaps the most tentative yes I've given to one of these and I think I'm very much on the fence with whether or not I actually like this paper, especially in its current form.</p><p>I believe this is a novel area (to my limited knowledge of clinical psych) and I think its focus on PTSD in war journalists is super interesting. However, I am very sceptical of the theory behind this paper and use of neuroscience to justify further categorisation of maladpative behaviour even more than the DSM-5 already does.</p><p>I do not know anything about biotypes and I have never heard the term before, but from the current writing I struggle to believe in their worth in this analysis. The neuroscience of PTSD is mentioned briefly and clusters of behaviour displayed by different people with PTSD. But I feel like the analysis only really describes individual experiences rather than something like a factor/ cluster analysis of PTSD symptoms. The analysis which is presented is a bit like a thematic analysis in the presentation and summary of your data. If this is to be published, I think a mixed-media thematic analysis of war journalists' shared experience would be a very cool way to go with the data you've presented. I struggle with the neuroscience part of the PTSD biotypes as without brain scans etc., I really don't know what lived experiences can really tell you about the brain, so a behavioural idiographic approach to this analysis not only makes more sense but seems a bit more theoretically coherent. I would prefer it greatly if you moved theory onto something like process-based therapy which focuses on the behaviour symptoms and lived experiences of people with PTSD, but I'm sure any clincal theory of behaviour will add some structure and merit to your discussion.</p><p><strong>Allen Arthur (Director of engagement at Solutions Journalism Network, freelance journalist):<br></strong>I believe this is an important tangle of issues to pursue for the health of media, democracy, and our communities. While potential PTSD in journalists may seem niche, the reality is that the seemingly endless cycle of reporting primarily on the world's worst and most devastating incidents is profoundly deteriorating the mental health and well-being of journalists. This, in turn, has led them to be less curious and more burnt out, along with producing an unfortunately (though understandably) cynical and hopeless worldview that filters into their reporting. That has negative effects on the fabric of our communities in a variety of ways we are just starting to understand, including perpetuating that cynicism and hopelessness among news consumers. The far-reaching effects of trauma on those tasked with helping others understand the world shouldn't be underestimated and deserve much more study.</p><p><strong>Anonymous 1:<br></strong>The writing is quite good. The text was easy to read and the topic was presented in a straightforward way with organized evidence. I did not feel there was a compelling argument for why war journalists' PTSD subtypes need to be or should be studied rather than studying PTSD subtypes generally. However, I recommend publication because it was intriguing to see these ideas combined this way, and a compelling case is made that the study of war journalists' PTSD *could* provide insight and better outcomes.</p><p><strong>Oswell Moyo (Media and Communication Researcher, MPhil Media and Society Studies, Bsc Journalism and Media Studies):</strong></p><p><em>Does the article contain novel ideas that have the potential to advance science?</em></p><p>This article brings into fore novel ideas about important but neglected Biotypes of PTSD in War Journalists. The article comes at a time when the world is getting polarized and rooted in economic wars fronted by the largest economies, namely the United States of America and China. At the time of writing, Russian- Ukraine war, Israel and Palestine Conflict, unending African conflicts in the SAHEL Region, Democratically Republic of Congo and Mozambique conflicts are at the centre stage with the need for research on the neuroscience of journalism and journalist PTSD.

For me the preprint “All Crises are Unhappy in their Own Way: The role of societal instability in shaping the past” by Hoyer et al. (2024) is such a piece of work. They have built a new dataset on top of the Seshat history database (Turchin et al., 2019) (1). Their new data is meant to capture the majority of big crises from the beginning of recorded history until around the beginning of the 20th century. They use this dataset to try to prove or disprove a large group of history’s big narratives in one big swoop.</p><h1>The grand narratives of history</h1><p>When we talk about the history of our species, often grand narratives are used. These try to explain why history happens or what major trends we can see developing from the deep past to today. Some famous examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Steven Pinker’s argument that violence has been decreasing for millennia and that we are living in the most peaceful time since humanity exists.</p></li><li><p>Joseph Tainter’s theory of diminishing returns of complexity, which we discussed in more detail <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-06-06-collapse_overview/\">in an earlier post</a>. The complexity view of collapse proposes that societies become increasingly unsustainable as solutions to problems create a burden of maintaining that complexity.</p></li><li><p>Peter Turchin’s secular cycles, <a href=\"https://existentialcrunch.substack.com/p/mapping-out-collapse-research#%C2%A7structural-demographic-theory\">also described in an earlier post</a>. Secular cycles assume societies rise and fall through phases of cooperation fueled by growth turning to competition due to resource limitations.</p></li></ul><p>Other examples, which cannot be attributed to a specific person:</p><ul><li><p>The major world religions exist to provide a social glue that makes interaction of individuals outside of their direct kin possible. This (allegedly) leads to less crises in regions where the majority of people belong to one of the major world religions.</p></li><li><p>Over time societies built institutions, which allow them to control crises better.</p></li><li><p>Greater crises lead to greater transformations and reforms.</p></li></ul><p>Hoyer and co-authors think that all of those are potentially the product of cherry picking. We therefore need a big dataset, which contains as many crises as possible, as well as events that could have become a major crisis, but didn’t.</p><h1>How to build a gigantic crises dataset</h1><p>To create a big dataset about crises, you first have to define what you mean when you are talking about crises. The definition used by Hoyer et al. is:</p><p>“We define crisis as a period of high societal stress and risk of systemic dysfunction - in effect, times when signs of unrest, institutional failing or decline, and/or socio-political instability appear on the rise compared to previous generations (until roughly 50 years earlier).”</p><p>They acknowledge that crisis is not the best word for this as it is more concerned with the time before, after and during what we usually see as a crisis, but think that we don’t have any better, so they stick with it. To clarify what counts as a crisis, here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p>The times of troubles in Russia</p></li><li><p>The French Revolution</p></li><li><p>Fragmentation of the Mughal Empire</p></li><li><p>Meiji Restoration in Japan</p></li></ul><p>To find all the actual and potential crises, they talked to a large group of historical experts and read everything they could find in the literature that could give them hints. They end up with 250 cases, from which they used 168 in their final analysis, as the rest did not have enough data available to be reliable. Scale wise, these entries could relate to everything from a city state to a global empire. To group these things together, they use the term polity (2). The dataset contains samples from all over the world and covers everything between the Bronze Age and the early 20th century. It is somewhat skewed to more modern crises, as we have more data available. For each of those samples they collected a wide array of data:</p><ul><li><p>Crisis outcomes: Does the crisis result in a civil war, a revolution, etc? As the crisis definition is trying to capture a broad period of time, these crisis outcomes do not necessarily have to be the endpoint of a crisis.</p></li><li><p>Crisis intensity: This includes factors like how much the population declined, if the elite lost their positions, assassinations of rulers, if the state remained intact or was partially or completely dismantled. They then sum those all up to give every crisis a turmoil score.</p></li><li><p>Reform: How much the state reformed after the crisis. This focuses on reforms which improved things like well-being and freedom. For example, expansion of suffrage or major public goods programs.</p></li><li><p>Polity metadata: Things like duration of the crisis, lifespan of the polity, geography, religion.</p></li><li><p>Societal complexity: The overall complexity of the polity. This includes things like scale (territorial extent, population, …), hierarchical complexity (how many levels your hierarchy has in admin, military and religion), governance (how professional and standardized your bureaucracy is), infrastructure, informational complexity (is writing present, how did you keep your records, …), money (what kind of money you used). The overall complexity is then represented as the first principal component of all these measures.</p></li></ul><h1>An overview of past crises</h1><p>Based on this massive dataset, Hoyer et al. do a wide variety of analysis with the data. This is mostly simple correlations and descriptive statistics, so I think with more powerful tools, there are likely a lot of other insights to be gleaned from this data. But even with such simple approaches, they provide a lot of fascinating results.</p><h3>There is no typical crisis</h3><p>All crises tend to be somewhat unique and they differ a lot in their properties. While the median duration of a crisis is 22 years, the range is between < 1 year and 200+ years. There is also no typical outcome of a crisis. While around 50% of the crises end in some kind of civil war, there are a lot of other outcomes which can also also be observed (Figure 1). These outcomes are also often combined and a crisis can have a variety of different outcomes at once. Quite relevant to this living literature review, only around 5 % of crises result in some kind of collapse.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png\" width=\"649\" height=\"380.199829205807\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":686,\"width\":1171,\"resizeWidth\":649,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Consequences\",\"title\":\"Consequences\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Consequences\" title=\"Consequences\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa90dac48-21c5-4d22-b49a-09daf8710e73_1171x686.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1: Consequences of crises and their occurance rate</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Crisis intensity and subsequent reforms do not correlate</h3><p>The distribution of crisis intensity and the extent of reforms are quite different.

Notably, the severity of crises has not diminished over time; significant crises were as likely in 1850 as they were in 1000 BC. This finding appears to be fairly robust. The data may be skewed towards recent crises, but we should anticipate that the crises in a deeper past should be more severe to even make it into the historical record. If there is any trend in the data, it is that crises in the last thousand years have been somewhat more severe compared to earlier periods. However, there appears to be a correlation with the life cycle of a polity. Analysis of crisis distribution within a polity’s lifespan reveals that crises in the latter half tend to be marginally more severe (Figure 3). Despite this, the likelihood of reforms remains relatively constant throughout a polity’s lifetime. This same figure contains both alarming and hopeful insights: while civilizations can endure major crises and persist for long periods thereafter, even minor crises have the potential to bring about their end.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"456.8328947368421\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":693,\"width\":760,\"resizeWidth\":501,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Crises over time\",\"title\":\"Crises over time\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Crises over time\" title=\"Crises over time\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb98e09b-0413-41f2-a070-cb3a73173f8b_760x693.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The level of crisis turmoil appears to be independent of world region, suggesting that geographical location does not significantly impact the severity of crises experienced. Additionally, regions where world religions constitute the majority faith tend to undergo slightly less severe crises. Moreover, larger crises are more likely to result in state-related outcomes (meaning things like being conquered by a rival or having a civil war), with population decline being also slightly correlated with crisis intensity.</p><h3>State Characteristics and Reform</h3><p>As stated above the extent of reforms does not correlate at all with crisis severity. However, there are a variety of other factors that increase or decrease the level of reforms. One important factor is revolution (4). If a revolution happened, in 65% of the cases reforms followed, while if no revolution happened, reform only followed in 23% of the cases. Interestingly, even in the revolution subset of the data, there is no correlation between crisis severity and number of reforms. This seems to indicate that revolutions make reforms more likely, even if the revolution did not lead to any major crisis afterwards. However, assessing reforms here is quite complex. Reforms may also follow a regime change.</p><p>The administrative complexity of a state is another important factor. Higher administrative complexity tends to hinder reform efforts, with the idea being that the intricacies of highly specialized bureaucratic systems can impede the implementation of new policies and structures. Conversely, polities with smaller geographical size and lower administrative complexity show more reforms. Possibly because they allow for more streamlined decision-making processes and thus easier implementation of changes.</p><p>Finally, the overall hierarchical structure of a state plays a role in determining its openness for reform. While an increased number of hierarchical levels within a state typically correlates with higher rates of reform, this trend is contingent upon the hierarchy not being predominantly situated within the administrative apparatus of the state. Or in other words, if you have parallel power structures in a state, this seems to make it easier to enact reforms. Interestingly, the complexity of the different hierarchies tend to correlate very highly with each other. This indicates that there is some kind of sweet spot in hierarchy and the distribution of power in a polity that allows easier reforms.</p><h1>Which historical narratives hold up?</h1><h3>Violence has decreased over human history (Steven Pinker)</h3><p>Hoyer and coauthor’s data does not support Pinker’s claim that violence has declined over the long run: the severity of crises has not decreased over time. If anything it has increased in the last 1000 years. However, it’s important to note that Pinker focuses primarily on the decline in the number of violent deaths over time, whereas the dataset presented here examines the intensity of crisis periods and also includes some crises caused by natural disasters. Therefore, Pinker’s hypothesis may still hold true, but must be qualified with the acknowledgment that it may not necessarily indicate a more peaceful era overall, but rather only a decrease in violent deaths amid ongoing crises.</p><h3>Complexity has diminishing returns (Joseph Tainter)</h3><p>The findings from Hoyer and colleagues do not invalidate the theory of diminishing returns of complexity. Tainter’s theory suggests that as a society progresses, its resilience diminishes due to the increasing resources needed to maintain solutions to previously resolved societal issues. The data presented here, (Figure 3) aligns with this theory by demonstrating a rise in crisis severity over the lifespan of a polity. However, the strength of this trend is relatively weak, which creates some inconsistency with research on societal longevity, discussed in a <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-12-04-bad_luck/\">previous post</a>, indicating a clear trend of increased collapse likelihood with polity age. Nevertheless, this shows that the complexity theory has stood strong against two independent attempts to falsify it with quantitative data.</p><h3>Secular cycles (Peter Turchin) </h3><p>The idea of secular cycles or any cyclical approach to history cannot be validated with the data here. If the secular cycles idea holds true, we should expect that polities end with a major crisis event. This does not seem to be the case here, which makes this hypothesis less likely to be true.</p><h3>Religions as social glue</h3><p>This hypothesis seems to be true, but only to a small extent. The major religions seem to make crises less severe, but only by a small amount.</p><h3>Building institutions helps to survive crises</h3><p>The question if this historical narrative is true is a bit more difficult to answer. We already discussed in a <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">previous post</a> that more state capacity seems to be important to make it through a crisis. Such an argument is also echoed by Hoyter et al.. Still, their study also shows that too much bureaucracy is also not helpful and that parallel hierarchies make reforms more likely. To me this seems to indicate that somewhere in the space of hierarchies and state capacity there is a somewhat optimal range for reform and resilience, but from the paper it does not become clear where exactly this range might be.</p><h3>Greater crises lead to greater transformation.</h3><p>This historical idea seems the most clearly false under Hoyer and colleagues data. There is no indication that bigger crises lead to bigger transformation. Even if you look at revolutions, which lead to more reforms, the size of the crisis is not correlated to how many reforms are enacted afterwards.</p><h1>Why are some crises worse than others and why do some crises lead to reform?</h1><p>The answer is somewhat beyond the scope of the paper, but Hoyer and coauthors still discuss some potential explanations of why this might be happening:</p><ul><li><p>The size of the external shock: Many crises are caused by events outside of the influence of the polity. For example, a large-scale drought (5) could push a society beyond its breaking point even if it is well prepared.</p></li><li><p>Elite behavior: The response of elites varies significantly even to similar crises. Hoyer et al. illustrate this with the case of the Black Death and how elites in both Egypt and England reacted differently. In England, the crisis prompted wealth redistribution and the advancement of workers’ rights, contributing in part to the onset of the industrial revolution. Conversely, in Egypt, the crisis was poorly managed, resulting mainly in increased repression and no redistribution of wealth. This highlights the question of whether elites are capable of equitably distributing the costs of crises across society, rather than placing the burden solely on the less well off.</p></li><li><p>State capacity: As mentioned above, the more state capacity you have the more you can prepare for crises and the quicker you can move resources once the crisis happens. However, you have to manage at the same time that the state is not made inflexible by an overly complex bureaucracy.</p></li><li><p>Revolutions: One of the most fascinating results of this study is that revolutions seem to be one of the major drivers of reform. However, as there is no connection to the size of the crises, this seems to imply that the best way to push for reforms is to make a revolution, but somehow manage to keep the revolution under control, so it does not spiral into big turmoil.</p></li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>As with all good pieces of science, this paper opens up at least as many new questions as it answers old ones. However, it tries to give answers to an impressive amount of questions. Not all of them have been answered, but still this paper presents a lot of compelling evidence for them. This highlights the power of quantitative history, while also showcasing the massive amount of work that has to go into it to make it happen. This paper builds on the work of hundreds or even thousands of other researchers. I hope such research continues to be funded and produced. Especially, as the team around Hoyer also plans to extend the timeline of the dataset until today. Not only would this give even more accurate answers to the questions discussed here, it would also provide a pretty strong datapoint to the question if history in the last ~100-200 years is a continuation of past trends or is something new that cannot be compared to earlier history (6).</p><h2>Endnotes</h2><ol><li><p>A vast historical dataset, which we have already mentioned a bunch of times on this blog: <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-10-lessons_from_the_past/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2024-02-08-climate_collapse/\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-11-15-collapse_models/\">4</a></p></li><li><p>Which they define as: “We define a polity as an independent political unit which can range from villages (local communities) through simple and complex chiefdoms to states and empires.”</p></li><li><p>You can also make a good argument that this is not really a normal distribution, as we might be undersampling very minor crises.

We will first explore the different schools of collapse research in roughly chronological order. These schools can also be seen as representatives of how we should think about collapse in general.

They develop and adapt, and if they fail to do so, they die. Much of it is originally based on the main work by Edward Gibbon, “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”. In this opus, Gibbons explores what might have caused the end of the Roman Empire. According to him the main reason the Roman Empire (and thus possibly other cultures as well) ceased to exist was the loss of civic virtues in its citizens, caused by decadence.</p><p>His ideas were very influential for collapse research, and how collapse is viewed in general. For example, in 1926, Spengler’s “Decline of the West” argued “The West” peaked before World War I, and would subsequently crumble, because it had lost its ancient ways. However, today, this view on collapse is seen as discredited, as it is too simplistic, and often inscribes certain cultures as inherently more valuable than others. Still, these ideas are deeply ingrained, especially in western, conservative circles. There they are used for example to frame migrants as disruptors of culture, who will bring on the fall of civilization by corrupting enlightenment values.</p><h3>Limits to growth</h3><p><em>“People will always try to consume all available resources”</em></p><p>Limits to growth is the idea that the Earth has a fixed carrying capacity it can support in the long term. This kind of thinking has experienced several transformations over time. The first variant of this view is the concept of the Malthusian Trap, which was first developed by Thomas Malthus in 1798. The main idea of the Malthusian trap is that poor people will always have as many children as can be supported by society’s resources, so that available resources act as a strict regulator of overall population size, possibly via famines and other catastrophes (see <a href=\"https://existentialcrunch.substack.com/p/escaping-the-malthusian-trap\">an earlier post here for a more detailed explanation</a>). This idea had a resurgence in the 1960s in the USA around the book “Population Bomb” by Paul Ehrlich, but quickly decreasing population growth in the 20th century has proven it untrue for post-industrial civilizations.</p><p>The idea of the Malthusian trap lives on today in the ideas of limits to growth by the Club of Rome (Meadows et al., 1974), in the notion of so-called planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009) and the degrowth movement. Planetary boundaries are defined as parts of the Earth system that have to stay within certain boundaries to make this planet habitable for the long term. The underlying assumption is that human civilization developed in a stable window of environmental conditions in the Holocene, and is therefore adapted to it. Every transgression of those conditions could lead to collapse, as humanity is not adapted to the environment outside of them.</p><p>How rigid those boundaries are, and how much they could contribute to a collapse is hotly debated. For example, Kareiva & Carranza (2018) argue that from all planetary boundaries only climate change has a clear path to a potential collapse, while Cernev (2022) explores scenarios where also other overstepped planetary boundaries could lead to an increased chance of a global collapse . Some argue that the path from exponential growth to collapse is typical for any kind of civilization, even extraterrestrial ones (see <a href=\"https://existentialcrunch.substack.com/p/the-universal-anthropocene\">here for a deeper explanation</a>.</p><h3>Collapse by complexity</h3><p><em>“Societies get ever more complex, but at some point complexity cannot be supported”</em></p><p>In the complexity view on collapse (introduced by Joseph Tainter, 1988), societies have to continuously solve problems (for example, how to provide more food for their citizens). These problems arise from a society’s interaction with its environment and internal dynamics. The key assumption is that every solution found increases the complexity of the society, and thus the energy it needs to sustain itself. The trouble is, usually societies can only increase in complexity. Past solutions have to be permanently maintained, while new problems need new and additional solutions. For example, consider a sewage system. This stops people from simply dropping their feces in the streets, but you cannot “solve” sewage. Instead you have a very complex sewage system that you most continuously monitor, repair and extend.</p><p>Tainter also argues that problems arise if the energy return of investment declines, by which he means that you have to continuously increase the amount of energy you invest to get new energy. This happens because societies start with the most easily accessible energy and once this source of energy is used up, the next sources of energy will necessarily be more complex to access. A society collapses at the point where it lacks the energy to sustain the complexity it has accumulated (Brozović, 2023).</p><p>This theory is seen as the most compact theory of collapse, as it can be used for every society without having to make adaptations (Brozović, 2023).</p><h3>Structural demographic theory</h3><p><em>“History is made of recurring patterns and we can measure them”</em></p><p>If traditional theories of cultural evolution are a narrative based style of collapse research, structural demographic theory is the opposite and tries to be as quantitative as possible. The main proponent of this kind of history, Peter Turchin, uses mathematical modeling that relies on extensive data collected from history to explore societal dynamics in the past. This has resulted in some very impressive datasets about history (Turchin et al., 2023), which can be used to test specific hypotheses. One of the main findings in this field of research are called secular cycles (Turchin & Nefedov, 2009).</p><p>Secular cycles describe a recurring pattern in history. It starts with a growing population that also has room to grow. The growth leads to more resources for everyone, which leads to an overall cooperative atmosphere. However, at some point, the room to grow shrinks, so that people can only get more resources if they take it from others. Population increases also depress real wages whilst also leading to an overproduction of elites relative to elite positions.This decreases trust and peace until it possibly triggers a redistributive event, which could be something like a civil war, which in turn decreases the population and the cycle starts anew.</p><p>While this approach of history creates very elegant theories, it has also been criticized as being too simplistic and having a too narrow focus on easily measurable variables (Maini, 2020). The proponents of this school counter that only a large sample history can give you reliable results. In a recent paper, Daniel Hoyer describes the failures of past schools of collapse and links them all to being too focussed on small, biased samples and case studies (Hoyer, 2022). Hoyer thinks that only a large, representative sample gives you a chance of getting general insights.</p><h2>What even counts as collapse?</h2><p>So far we’ve seen four main approaches to thinking about societal collapse. The cultural school puts the blame on the cultural decadence of a society. The limits to growth school emphasizes societies pushing beyond the environmental envelope that can sustain them. The complexity collapse school emphasizes the unsustainable increase in social complexity. And structural demographic schools emphasize a shift from positive sum growth to zero sum conflict once room to expand reaches its limits. However, are all of those approaches even talking about the same thing?</p><p>There is no definitive definition of collapse. This has become even more true as collapse research has shifted from being a part of history, to the more transdisciplinary kind of research it is today (Brozović, 2023). Over time, collapse research has become less qualitative, and more quantitative (going from Gibbon to Turchin).</p><p>Some examples of collapse definitions:</p><ul><li><p>Collapse is the fragmentation or disarticulation of a particular political apparatus and transformation is a broad concept engulfing different sorts of societal changes (Faulseit, 2016)</p></li><li><p>Collapse is a rapid, uncontrolled, unexpected and ruinous decline of something that had been going well before (Bardi, 2020)</p></li><li><p>Collapse is a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area for an extended time (Diamond, 2011)</p></li></ul><p>All those definitions have one thing in common: They are rather vague. What counts as a drastic decrease? What is a significant loss? How would we even measure sociopolitical complexity? When reading anything about collapse, we should always keep in mind the definition of collapse the author had in mind, because drawing conclusions depends on it. Interestingly, even though the possible definitions vary, the past collapse events references are the same. In a certain way it seems that you could answer the question “When can we classify an event as collapse?” with “I know it when I see it”. For example, there seems to be a very broad agreement that the end of the Roman Empire can be counted as a collapse, independent of the specific definition of collapse.</p><p>Others argue against the idea of collapse as a whole. Lawler (2010) argues that, for instance, the fall of the Maya was not really a collapse, but more of a transformation to a different kind of society. However, at least to me, this seems to be mostly a semantics game. Whenever someone argues that historical event X was not a collapse, but a transformation, they typically still acknowledge that the society at hand underwent significant changes and societal complexity was lost. The disagreement is not about the event, but if it was quick, big and permanent enough to count as collapse. This ultimately boils down to a value judgment about the preferred definition of collapse by the person who is making the claim. As the definition of collapse is so vague this cannot be really resolved until there is a widely accepted definition of collapse. In this series I’ll be using a variety of definitions, though focusing primarily on the kinds of events that people regard as bad.</p><h2>Frameworks for causes of collapse</h2><p>Whereas the definition of collapse remains vague, the search for causes of collapse has found somewhat more crisp results. We have come a long way from Edward Gibbon’s explanation that the Romans were simply not virtuous enough to avoid collapse. In general, there is now the view in collapse research that monocausal explanations are too simplistic (Brozović, 2023). Still, in the explanations of collapse we can see a distinction between research focussing on society’s interaction with the external environment and research focussing on the internal mechanisms of a society or even viewing collapse as a concept that applies to all complex systems and not only societies. In the following I will show three frameworks which highlight the differences between these research directions.</p><h3>Environmental Framework (Example: Jared Diamond)</h3><p>Let’s begin with Jared Diamond’s work, one of the most well known collapse frameworks, which focuses on society’s interaction with its environment. Overall there are five factors Diamond sees as the main drivers of collapse (though note Diamond believes it is possible to take actions to mitigate each of these factors - for example, a well managed societal response can help mitigate a sudden shift in the climate).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png\" width=\"1347\" height=\"323\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":323,\"width\":1347,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Factor Diamond\",\"title\":\"Factor Diamond\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Factor Diamond\" title=\"Factor Diamond\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddfc397e-677e-4ef9-af8b-0fe4fcb6b579_1347x323.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Figure 2: Jared Diamond’s main factors of collapse</p><p>In addition to the five main factors, Diamond also identifies twelve environmental problems that are often connected to collapse.

Red: Negative Feedback, Green: Positive Feedback, Purple: Positive/Negative Feedback, Grey boxes: Main Factors, White Boxes: Subfactors.</p><p>While Diamond’s focus on the environment and humanity’s interaction with it makes intuitive sense to me, it should be noted that Diamond’s work has been criticized by anthropologists for being too focussed on the environment (e.g. Butzer (2012)), and misrepresenting or cherry picking historical evidence (Hunt & Lipo, 2012).</p><h3>Societal Framework (Example: Karl Butzer)</h3><p>In contrast to Diamond, Karl Butzer focuses on the societal response instead of the environment (Butzer, 2012). The environment has a role in potentially triggering an economic crisis, but even this is only assumed to happen after an internally generated economic decline. When a crisis is triggered the reaction depends on whether society manages to end up in positive or negative feedback loops. In either case, reconstruction is possible, but is more likely to be incomplete after a collapse. Butzer further discriminates between a collapse and complete societal devolution, though he does not really define either. It reads as if you can still recover from a collapse, while a devolution leads to a complete dissolution of state-like structures. This focus on economic growth can also be found in other works, e.g. Samo Burja’s great founder theory (Burja, 2018).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png\" width=\"528\" height=\"812\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":812,\"width\":528,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Model Butzer\",\"title\":\"Model Butzer\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Model Butzer\" title=\"Model Butzer\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0d1e618-c7d6-408f-be2b-7e0dac611b31_528x812.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Figure 4: Karl Butzer’s Framework of societal collapse.</p><h3>Meta Framework (Example: Cumming and Peterson)</h3><p>The framework of Cumming & Peterson (2017) goes up one level in abstraction in comparison to the other two. While Butzer and Diamond are only interested in societal collapse, Cumming and Peterson see collapse as a more general phenomenon. The examples they look at are ranging from Bronze Age collapse to the collapse of bee hives. They come to the conclusion that the type of collapse that happens is based on the structure of the system. For example, if you have a hierarchical and individualistic structure you get the kind of collapse as Peter Turchin describes in his ideas of secular cycles. Overall, I find it more convincing, as it is a more holistic picture. It is also even more abstract than the other models proposed, which makes it more difficult to apply. However, Cumming and Peterson articulate that they see their work as the basis of an interdisciplinary study of collapse, which sounds quite promising.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png\" width=\"1188\" height=\"844\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":844,\"width\":1188,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Model Meta\",\"title\":\"Model Meta\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Model Meta\" title=\"Model Meta\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0497f9c-d2ff-4c37-acb4-03ff229d0889_1188x844.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Figure 5: Types of collapse based on the structure of the system from Cumming and Peterson (2017)</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>My main takeaway is that this field still has a long way to go.

There are voices warning that our global society has become decadent (writers like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/28/21137971/the-decadent-society-ross-douthat-book\">Ross Douthat</a>), that we are pushing against environmental limits (for example, <a href=\"https://rebellion.global/\">Extinction Rebellion</a>), that we are having a decreasing return of investment for our energy system (for example, work by <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2013.0126\">David Murphy</a>) and that there has been an overproduction of elites in the last decades (writers like <a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-elite-overproduction-hypothesis\">Noah Smith</a>). This means we have warning signs that fit all major viewpoints on collapse. Moreover, new technological capabilities pose novel dangers that require us to extrapolate beyond the domain of historical experience. All this means that understanding how collapse really happens is rather urgent.</p><p>While the work of Jared Diamond and others brought the field forward by sparking a variety of discussions and new research, the field of collapse research is still in the process of finding a theory that is widely accepted in the community. There is no clear definition of what collapse is. Depending on their background, people argue for a bigger focus on the environment or a bigger focus on societal factors. This also seems to lead to a lot of discussion about semantics. Researchers criticize each other’s definition of collapse, even though most of the researchers seem to agree that there are clearly discontinuities in the historical record.</p><p>The closest to having an actual model of collapse prediction is the field of structural demographic theory. However, their focus is mostly on internal mechanisms of society, and less so on the interaction of society with the environment. A good way forward would be to couple structural demographic theory work with a more complex environmental model. This could also be combined with the work of Cumming and Peterson, to make it more widely applicable. However, this is a long term project, which requires much more work. Still, it would be an important piece of work, as we need to understand how past collapse has worked, to be safe against the complex, intricate and possible unexpected ways our society might be in danger today. Something along those lines has been proposed by Hoyer (2022) and partially implemented in Hoyer et al. (2024). I discuss this <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2024-04-09-big_data_history/\">in another post </a>in more detail, but the general gist is that it is difficult to attribute the survival of a society to a small number of factors. Still, if you had to choose the interplay of elite behavior, the state capacity and the size the external shock is probably a good place to start looking. This is obviously only a partial answer, but at least it provides a good place to start looking.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

A Rather Linguistic Introduction</h2><p>The word “charlatan” made its way into English from French, where it originally meant a “potion seller”, a loud hawker noisily telling the crowd about a new miraculous remedy. The word likely comes from the Italian “<em>ciarlare</em>”, meaning “to chat” or “to prattle”. A classic example of a charlatan is Molière's Tartuffe, who <em>always knows the trick of cloaking him with what we most revere</em>. In English, the word “charlatan”, like many other French words (allons-y!), acquires a somewhat romantic tint. This is partially due to the charismatic image of the con artist, the “noble swindler”—from Robin Hood to Danny Ocean and his eleven friends—which has been established in popular culture. Below, I will often use the word “charlatan”, and I would like to ask particularly sensitive readers to remember that in its original meaning, “a charlatan” is, after all, “a blowhard”.</p><p>Now, a few words about the use of the second (or rather, the first) word in the title. Science seems like an obvious word, despite the fact that a large part of this article will be dedicated to its explanation. I just want to note the following: when I use the word science without quotes in the article, I mean science “as it should be”—an idealized version of science. It must be said that science, in the form it currently exists, is quite close to this. However, there are differences, and it's worth mentioning them. The reason for these differences is mainly the “human factor”, but more on that later. Speaking of people, the word scientist without quotes will exclusively mean a good, proper scientist. Thankfully, there are many of them, and we should aspire to be like them.</p><p>One more clarification: in most cases, in this article, the word “science” will mean “experimental science”, thereby excluding, for example, mathematics. Mathematics is undoubtedly a science—and what a science it is!—but it plays by somewhat different rules than the natural sciences, and I do not feel competent enough to explain them. In addition to that, I will refrain from talking about medicine. There is a debate on whether medicine should be considered a strict science. I have my own thoughts on that, but I don’t want to digress from the point of this specific essay. Plus, after COVID, the topic seems overheated, and I believe that takes, just like revenge, are better cold.</p><p>In this multi-part essay, I'll try to do two things: first, to present several interesting examples of outright charlatans, and second, to try to explain in simple terms the banal thing—how real scientists differ from them. I don't aim to prove the insolvency of any pseudoscientific theory or expose fraudsters. This has long been done for me—at best, I'll describe the evidence in very broad strokes and provide a link to more complete information. The people I talk about are deceivers. My goal is slightly different—to show that all such charlatans behave more or less the same way and that their stories are similar. That a person without deep knowledge of a particular science can determine, at least superficially, whether they are dealing with a real scientist or a charlatan. Therefore, I will spend more time not on the scientific aspect but on the development of events.</p><h2>2. Deception in the Academy</h2><p>Before discussing charlatans who are not scientists in any sense of the word, it's necessary to mention what happens when real scientists become frauds. Unfortunately, this does happen and, sadly, not as rarely as one might wish. It is both easy and difficult for one scientist to deceive another. Difficult because the bullshit meter is quite strong in this community. Easy because if the data seems reliable, the conclusions reasonable, and the topic isn't of paramount importance, it might not be checked by anyone. However, when scientific fraud is uncovered, the deceiver often finds themselves in a very bad situation. Here are a few well-known examples.</p><h4>2.1 Hwang Woo-suk</h4><p>Hwang Woo-suk, a globally renowned Korean scientist, made his name in cloning, which was also his downfall. In truth, there were always uncertainties surrounding him. He rose to fame in 1999 by claiming to have cloned a cow (the fifth in the world), and then another one, showing that his experimental approach can be replicated. The community believed him, despite the lack of solid data. Hwang then expressed his desire to clone a Siberian tiger and a mammoth, sparking widespread interest.</p><p>The next, truly great achievement of Hwang's team was the derivation of a line of human embryonic stem cells, published in Science. This stirred even more interest since it was previously thought to be nearly impossible. Hwang claimed that his team had to use 242 human eggs to obtain one stem cell. A year later, even more impressive results were achieved—11 lines from 184 eggs. To understand the significance of this discovery: embryonic stem cells can be used for tissue regeneration, cancer treatment, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart attacks, strokes, blindness, and so on. Yes, and for cloning humans. When an unknown Korean veterinarian achieved this, everyone was quite surprised. The Times named him one of the most important people of 2004. In 2005, Hwang Woo-suk became the first person in the world to clone a dog, an Afghan hound named Snuppy, after SNU, Seoul National University.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg\" width=\"317\" height=\"492.09386281588445\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":430,\"width\":277,\"resizeWidth\":317,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"Snuppy in 2006, a few days before his first birthday\",\"title\":\"Snuppy in 2006, a few days before his first birthday\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Snuppy in 2006, a few days before his first birthday\" title=\"Snuppy in 2006, a few days before his first birthday\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffac944f1-1e52-41b9-9698-f3ac52b83a6f_277x430.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Snuppy, source: <a href=\"https://en.snu.ac.kr/snunow/snu_media/news?md=v&bbsidx=122998\">Seoul National University</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Then the serious problems began. First off, everything related to human cloning is ethically murky. It turned out that the female donors were paid very little for the eggs. His research violated the Helsinki Declaration. Hwang resigned from all official positions. “I was blinded by work and the pursuit of success,” he said at a press conference. That same year, it was proven that all 11 cell lines were fakes. Hwang apologized but did not admit to the fraud, claiming his project had been sabotaged. He asked for six months to prove the validity of his research, but he was no longer trusted. The investigation revealed that he had coerced women working in his laboratory to donate eggs for his experiments.</p><p>After this, no one listened to him anymore, and his earlier results were also doubted. As a scientist, Hwang Woo-suk was completely discredited. He was expelled from the university and banned from practicing science in South Korea and America. Moreover, he was given a two-year suspended sentence. His scientific career was not finished, however, he just moved from the academy to the private sector.</p><p>It's unclear whether Dr. Woo-suk could actually clone humans. He maintained until the end that he could. He certainly could cows and dogs. There was undoubtedly real science in his research, as well as undeniable result fabrication. Dr. Woo-suk himself was a true fanatic, working in the lab for eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. “If I weren't a scientist,\" he said, \"I would have become a monk. I respect their way of life.”</p><p>For a fuller story, you can also check out a recent Netflix documentary, “King of Clones”.</p><h4>2.2 Jan Hendrik Schön</h4><p>Jan Hendrik Schön would have received the Nobel Prize if he hadn't been a fraudster and a liar. A physicist by training, he specialized in micro- and nanoelectronics. In 2000, he announced that he had succeeded in creating a transistor the size of a molecule—the dream of every microelectronics specialist. In 2001, scientific papers under his name were published every eight days. In 2002, it turned out that he had made everything up from start to finish. He, apparently, simply invented all his data “out of thin air”.</p><p>For those in the know, this is astonishing. Astonishingly difficult. The man was infinitely talented—but not very wise. He was caught in the most banal way—because some of the data were duplicated, even down to the level of random noise. That doesn't happen; he messed up. That was enough to start an official investigation. It was found that: a) Schön kept no laboratory records; b) all raw data were deleted from his computer (because “there wasn't enough space”); c) experimental samples were destroyed or damaged. This is quite suggestive.</p><p>As a result, Schön confessed to falsification and data fabrication. Eight of his papers were retracted from Science, seven from Nature. Fifteen papers in journals of such caliber in three years, to make it clear—almost a guaranteed Nobel Prize. Currently, there are perhaps five to seven active scientists in the world with such a publication record. Schön was stripped of his doctoral degree and banned from academic science. He went on to work as a consultant for some engineering firm.</p><p>The Schön case had a profound impact on science as a whole. Firstly, people began to review the principles by which papers are selected for journals. Secondly, the rules regarding co-authorship changed slightly. Schön started with a very successful series of papers, where the lead author was an already established and famous physicist. The data were fabricated there too, but the author's name carried certain weight, and the papers were allowed to be published. Sadly, this still happens quite often.</p><h4>2.3 Marc Hauser</h4><p>A biologist and primate behavior researcher who was accused of data manipulation and fabrication. Among other things, his claims that tamarins—small South American monkeys—could replicate and follow simple patterns and rules were called into question.</p><p>Interestingly, unlike the previous two individuals, Marc Hauser is a well-known, prominent scientist. He has published over two hundred papers and six books and has received several international awards. Moreover, his discovery, though important in his own field, isn't a global sensation like the previous two. Therefore, if deceit was involved, its motives are unclear.</p><p>In 2010, after a three-year investigation, a committee found Hauser responsible for eight different instances of data fabrication. An article in The New York Times dedicated to the investigation stated, among other things:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>There's a wide range of scientific misconduct, from losing information to fabricating it. It's still not entirely clear where Marc Hauser's work falls on this spectrum. He has only admitted to 'mistakes' made, not to misconduct.</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Nevertheless, a year later, Hauser resigned from Harvard and moved to the private sector. His scientific career was over. The sad story has an ironic afterthought: one of Hauser's research subjects was morality, moral behavior in animals, and the nature of moral decisions.</p><h4>24 Paul Kammerer</h4><p>Paul Kammerer simply painted a toad. Or maybe he didn't. He lived in Vienna in the early twentieth century and, like many respectable people of that time, believed in Lamarck's theory. This is, in case anyone has forgotten, a dubious theory about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. As my biology teacher used to say, “<em>No matter how many times you cut the tails off spaniels, they're still born with whole ones.</em>” Paul Kammerer, however, tried his best to prove the opposite. And he did! Kammerer claimed that his midwife toads exhibited “nuptial pads” (an acquired characteristic)—dark spots on their feet—which were inherited. His opponents claimed that Kammerer simply injected ink under their skin. Kammerer immediately admitted that the ink was injected, but blamed it on his assistant. This was in August 1926. Six weeks later, Kammerer ended his life.</p><p>An expected result from this story is the loss of interest in Lamarck’s theories by the scientific community. An unexpected result was that the only place that kept and even strengthened its Lamarckian approaches was the Soviet Union, which tried to do everything in reverse. We will talk about Trofim Lysenko in one of the next parts, but keep the toad-painting story in mind.</p><p>The story took another interesting turn in 2009. Alexander Vargas suggested that the phenomenon observed by Kammerer was not fabricated but was a result of epigenetic inheritance. Similar phenomena have been discovered in other organisms. This interpretation remains controversial, but in the future, I might have to remove Kammerer’s name from that list.</p><h4>2.5 Jacques Benveniste</h4><p>Perhaps the saddest and most embarrassing story happened with Jacques Benveniste. Moreover, I find the behavior of the scientific community that condemned him, not Benveniste himself, to be shameful. Benveniste, like Hauser, was already a well-known, prominent scientist. He discovered the structure of PAF and the nature of its interactions with histamine, and was the head of INSERM, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. Problems began in 1988 when he submitted an article to the journal Nature describing the action of antibodies at ultra-low concentrations. In his solutions, there were practically no antibodies left—only water. Essentially, Jacques Benveniste scientifically proved the phenomenon of homeopathy.</p><p>Everyone was a bit stunned, especially John Maddox, the then-editor of Nature. Independent laboratories were asked to confirm the results, and the article was eventually co-signed by scientists from four countries. The article, titled \"Human basophil degranulation triggered by very dilute antiserum against IgE,\" was published with a disclaimer, noting the incredulity of many referees and stating that there was no physical basis for such activity. Nature arranged for independent investigators to observe repetitions of the experiments.</p><p>The committee consisted of physicist John Maddox, chemist Walter Stewart, and... illusionist James Randi, who specializes in debunking fraud and charlatanism. I have nothing against Randi; he looks like a jolly old Santa, but he should not have been there. Based on Benveniste’s writing, he was deeply offended. He wrote in a column: “<em>What matters is that this \"exposé\" transformed a prestigious laboratory of more than 50 research workers into a feather in a magician's cap.</em>”</p><p>In short, the members of Benveniste's laboratory, where they had reportedly already opened the champagne in celebration, were shocked. The committee repeated Benveniste's experiment seven times. Three attempts were positive, and four were negative, leading Nature to decide that further investigation was necessary. After using a double-blind method and more precise measurements, it was established that Benveniste's data were erroneous. The committee concluded that the phenomenon observed by Professor Benveniste was not reproducible, and the effects were due to insufficient sample purification. Laboratories around the world still try to replicate Benveniste's experiment results, with very mixed success. There can be no general conclusions due to poor standardization of methods and the inability to distinguish artifacts from real experimental data. Similar experiments were later repeated, with some teams succeeding in replicating the results, and some teams failing.</p><p>Things only got worse afterward. Despite the obvious problems with his research, Benveniste stood by his claims, leading to reduced funding. He left academic science and started his own company dealing with “Digital Water”, along the way receiving two Ig Nobel Prizes—for the concept of \"water memory,\" not even his own idea, and for persistence. He died at the age of sixty-nine after heart surgery.</p><p>I genuinely feel sorry for Jacques Benveniste. He was probably wrong, and after his debacle with Nature, he began to make nonsensical claims, but he was initially treated very unfairly and indignantly. It's unseemly when a recognized scientist is judged by a former magician. It's unseemly when a scientist is apriori treated as a charlatan. This is precisely the case where the truth is the truth, but consideration for others should also be taken into account. As Voltaire said, “<em>Aime la vérité, mais pardonne à l'erreur</em>” (love truth, but pardon error). The humiliating commission could have been avoided. After all, they could have simply not published the work. But the Nature editor wanted to have his cake and eat it too—to publish a possible great scientific discovery without taking any responsibility if it turned out to be a lie. A shame.</p><h4>2.6 Interim Conclusions</h4><p>These are the stories about how scientists deceived each other and what came of it. If you've noticed a certain pattern, at the very least, they ceased to be scientists. Why do scientists do this? Not very often, but still, they do. Why? David Goodstein, a physicist and an educator, lists several reasons: career pressure; fear that someone else will get there first; laziness (meaning when there's a reluctance to meticulously conduct all control experiments), leading to artifacts being mistaken for real data; money; ideology. All these reasons, except maybe the spirit of competition and the fear of being outpaced, seem contrived to me. Honestly, money, fame, career—these are trivialities. Because if you've faked truly significant results, people will try to replicate them. And when no one can, you won't have any money or a career, and your fame will be exclusively of a notorious nature. The main reason seems to me to be an impregnable confidence in one's own correctness and in the beauty and correctness of one's own theory. A confidence—even faith—so strong that minor experimental discrepancies can be “overlooked”. This is a very dangerous thing. It's called pride. Every prominent scientist, before going to bed, should hit themselves on the head with a book of Karl Popper's “The Logic of Scientific Discovery” and say, “My theories are rubbish”. The chance that a scientist will develop an inferiority complex as a result is extremely low. The chance of a concussion is also low. The book isn't very thick.</p><p>We can take a breather here, as well as summarize the topic of how to distinguish science from non-science and a scientist from a deceiver. Scientists are very afraid of being accused of lying. Truly. It's real paranoia. Because reputation in the scientific world is very quickly ruined and practically impossible to restore. For a charlatan, however, an accusation of lying is merely a way to attract more attention to themselves. Therefore, if a person accused of fraud eagerly gives interviews, criticizes everything and everyone, compares themselves to Galileo/Copernicus/Giordano Bruno/(insert your option), and shouts about their own misunderstood genius—they are most likely a deceiver. A real scientist, upon finding incorrect data, is more likely to lock themselves in the lab and recheck it.</p><p>From this, incidentally, follows another indirect difference. Scientists almost never hide their methods. It's in every scientist's interest for as many people as possible to be able to replicate the experiment. Therefore, having achieved something extraordinary, a scientist first thoroughly rechecks it, then writes an article (patent, or both), and—rushes to tell the whole world. About exactly how they achieved such remarkable results. There are several reasons for this, and not the least of them is the fear of being accused of deceit.</p><p>Another reason—developing a new method in science is often valued more than remarkable results. For example, a new general reaction is likely to be valued more by colleagues than simply the synthesis of some rare and complex substance. Therefore, if a scientist has achieved remarkable results using a unique method they themselves developed, they will shout about the method first and foremost. The results come later—as the cherry on top.</p><p>A third reason, of course, is that the more people know and can use the new method, the further science as a whole will advance. That's also important.</p><p>So, if someone claims to have achieved unique results with a super-secret method available only to them, they are likely a deceiver. A scientist, on the other hand, will do their utmost to explain what the method is and how it works—so that any laboratory with the necessary equipment can replicate it. We will see examples of deceivers with unique, unavailable to anyone else methods in the next part of this article. We’ve just tipped our toes in the kiddie pool of charlatans—now it’s time to leave the academy and dive into the world of true hustlers. The real world.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>The rest of this essay can be found on my personal blog, <a href=\"https://tapwatersommelier.substack.com/\">Tap Water Sommelier</a>.

Their extraordinary predictive record has created an illusion of general predictability for all natural systems, while in practice, natural science is far less predictive on complex systems. A further distinction is proposed between systems amenable to experimental intervention (modular systems) and systems where observation or natural experiments are the main source of empirical information (non-modular systems).</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

Even experimental economics works with subjects from a given culture and social environment, so the <em>ceteris paribus</em> hypothesis (and the external validity of the results) is limited. When social sciences are put in their natural epistemic framework (complex non-modular systems) their degree of success and techniques are in line with those of similar natural sciences.</p><p>To some extent system controllability is the main determinant of scientific success. Consequently, the path towards more efficient and controlled social systems depends not only on a more exact understanding of human society but also on social science becoming a constructivist project where society is transformed with governance mechanisms designed to be homeostatic, predictable and welfare optimizing.</p><h3>The secret of Exact Natural Sciences</h3><p>The canonical narrative of the birth of modern science describes the development of Celestial Mechanics in the period between the heliocentric model of the Solar System (discovered by Copernicus in 1543) and Newton's discovery of the “System of the World” (1687). The complete description of the Solar System dynamics based on the three laws of motion and Universal Gravitation represents the earliest and most powerful success in the mathematization of natural science. In addition to its own relevance, there is a mythology around this story that highlights the conflict between science and faith (the posthumous publication of Copernicus's work and the trial of Galileo), and the idea of \"consilience\" (Wilson, 1988), reflected in the history of apple that falls on Newton's head dragged by the same gravitational force that keeps the Moon in orbit.</p><p>However, modern Philosophy of Science (both that which descends from Popperian falsifiability or Kuhn’s paradigmatic framework) does not emphasize the most interesting element in the history of Celestial Mechanics: the singularity of its object of study, that is, the Solar System. What makes the Solar System so unique is that it is one of the few, <em>perhaps the only natural system </em>to which the exact natural sciences are applied with almost complete predictive success.</p><p>This statement will undoubtedly be shocking to readers with a scientific culture, who have been educated in the idea that there is a relatively small set of mathematically expressible fundamental laws of Physics that explain the entirety of reality. Philosophically, I share that reductionist, emergentist and physicalist worldview (Macías, 2023). However, in practical terms the history of the development of the exact natural sciences (Physics and Chemistry), and the history of technology reveals that the systems for which a high predictive capacity has been achieved in practice <em>are artificial</em>.</p><p>The quantitative precision of Newton's laws has been replicated in other physical systems like lenses, batteries and electrical circuits, motors, chemical reactions, or microchips. However, most of these systems (unlike the Solar System) <em>are human creations</em>. Copper wires and batteries where electromagnetism is exactly applied are highly manufactured products. The molecularly homogeneous compounds to which the rules of stoichiometry and chemical thermodynamics can be applied are the result of a long process of discovery and complex manufacturing. The first task for historical chemists was manufacturing the “pure” substances <em>which are the alphabet of their discipline</em>.</p><h3>Modular and non-modular Complex Natural Systems</h3><p>Beyond the exact natural sciences, there are other natural sciences: those that study complex natural systems, both animate and inanimate. Within complex systems, a further categorization emerges: one that differentiates between “modular” systems—those amenable to controlled experimental manipulation—and “non-modular” systems, where such direct experimentation is not feasible.</p><p>Modern medicine is based on the possibility of carrying out controlled experiments, that is, taking two large and randomly assigned samples of patients, applying to some of them a “treatment” (and not to the other), and describing the differential effect of that treatment. A medication that “works well” does so “on average” in the treatment group, but in general it is very difficult to infer the effect of a treatment on a specific patient. Of course, physicians and biologists develop some causal understanding of “why” some treatments work and others don't, which in turn allows for the creation of more powerful and specific treatments. Even so, the gap in terms of precision and predictive capacity between Medicine on one side and Physics or Chemistry on the other is indisputable.</p><p>The last type of natural systems that will be considered is precisely the most difficult to address: the non-modular complex systems. In these systems it is not easy to delimit sufficiently isolated subsystems to be able to carry out controlled experiments, or the size of the systems makes manipulation impossible.</p><p>Among non-modular complex systems, we highlight the atmospheric system, complete ecosystems, or populations of a given species (both in the present and throughout Natural History). The natural sciences that study these systems are Climatology, Ecology, Population Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. In these systems, exact mathematical description is impossible, and experiments cannot be “replicated”, either due to the magnitude of the systems or due to the impossibility of approaching the “ceteris paribus” condition. The modularity of a complex system is not a binary characteristic: in most cases there are “natural experiments” or “quasi experiments” (vg. two different islands with a “clear” difference and a different ecology). But is the “clear” difference the only relevant one? Excluding random assignment the equivalence of treatment and control groups is difficult to assure and often controversial, and even more so extrapolating the results beyond the scope of the considered case (the external validity problem).</p><p>Lacking the strength of direct experimental manipulation, those sciences address the complexity of their objects of study through a form of mathematical modeling more metaphoric (less descriptive) than that of the exact natural sciences, but no less complex. The Lotka-Volterra equations, Sewall-Wright causal graph models, Maynard Smith and William Hamilton equations for fitness or the general atmospheric circulation models are the products of this modeling efforts, and all of them are more explanatory than predictive.</p><p>The previous discussion allows us to classify natural systems and the Sciences that study them into the following groups: i) The simple natural system (the Solar System, studied by Celestial Mechanics), ii) simplified artificial systems (domain of the exact sciences of Nature: Physics and Chemistry), iii) modular complex natural systems (Biology and Medicine) and iv) non-modular complex natural systems (Climatology, Population Genetics, Evolution).</p><h3>The human society as a complex non-modular system</h3><p>Social science is extremely wide both in its objects (that rank from the anthropology of hunter gatherers, or the inference of fundamental laws of history, to financial economics) and its methodology (from Hegelian dialectics to Econometrics and Game Theory). Reductionist intent is the most characteristic element of Science (Macías, 2023), and in my view the expression “social science” shall be reserved to the reductionist approaches to the study of human society (reductionism is named “methodological individualism” when applied to human interaction). When reductionism and rationality assumptions are combined, the result is the classical “economic imperialist” approach (Myerson, 1999), where Game Theory is the foundation; by relaxing rationality (but keeping reductionism), the field of “Behavioral Economics” appears.</p><p>The epistemic difference between social and natural sciences, which is evident when comparing integrated circuit design with macroeconomics blur almost to the point of disappearing when the discrepancies between Keynesians and neoclassicals are compared with those that divide evolutionary biologists on the issue of “group evolution” (Okasha, 2006). Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models and Climate Models are reasonably successful in explaining structural relationships, and they run into all sorts of fundamental difficulties when used as a predictive tool (see Muellbauer, 2015 for economics and Fildes and Kourentzes, 2011 in climate modelling).</p><p>The analysis of data in complex non-modular systems always lead to the development of a complex statistical theory for causality assessment based on structural equations (Pearl, Glymour and Jewell, 2016), and structural equations are used both by social scientists and biologists (predictably, ecologists are especially intensive users).</p><h3>Conclusion: the institutional design alternative to High Modernity</h3><p>Our previous discussion suggests that social systems and their scientific study are not “different” from similarly complex/controllable natural systems. The degree of complexity and controllability of a system is the main determinant of the degree of predictive success of a scientific endeavor (the “hardness” of the Science that studies it). The animistic idea that the human element changes the nature of the social system, and that “social science” is an oxymoron looks quite plausible when the Exact Natural sciences are directly compared to Economics, but when similar natural and social systems are compared, the social/natural boundary becomes less relevant.</p><p>Our epistemological classification leads to an immediate practical suggestion: the simplest way to increase the “hardness” of any science is to move from observation to control. Humanity has conquered the natural order mostly by intervention: engineering is based on the development of artificial systems designed to be controlled and stabilized. <em>Artificial homeostasis</em> (Maxwell, 1868) is the core of our technology from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device)\">Watt governor</a> to microelectronics.</p><p>Recently, there has been heightened interest in governance innovation, driven by factors such as populist politics and advancements in blockchain technology. New schemes for money, voting, public goods funding, sovereignty, and ownership have recently been proposed (Posner and Weyl, 2018; Weyl and Tang, 2024, Srinivasan, 2022; Buterin and Schneider, 2022).</p><p>Since Cleisthenes and Solon, even rudimentary forms of institutional design have proven able to transform societies, such that have achieved high levels of individual emancipation and economic and geopolitical success (Ober,2008 and 2015; Macias, 2022) mainly because of institutional superiority.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the implementation of welfare capitalism in the postwar period (Judt, 2005), institutional progress appears to have plateaued. The most advanced social systems, both in politics and private sector governance still resemble those of the late 1960s, often those of the XIX<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>Modern Social Science, especially that based on Mechanism Design, can be the basis of a new wave of institutional progress that can be deployed by firms, governments, and other communities. Unlike the High Modernity project of vertical rule by a technocratic class (Herbert, 2007), institutional design is (and has been since Aristotle and the American founding fathers) an inclusive project where the intellectual elite proposes the rules for the efficient integration of the preferences of the entire demos, avoiding both the autocratic temptation and the alienating paternalism (Krpan and Urbaník, 2021) of High Modernity.</p><p>The path towards more efficient and homeostatic social system depends not only on the accumulation of scientific knowledge, but also on social science becoming a constructivist project where society is transformed with distributed governance mechanisms.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><p>Buterin, V. and Schneider, N.

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.” Genesis 3:6-7</em></p></blockquote><p>By some accounts, <em>Homo Sapiens</em> evolved 200,000 years ago. However, there is little evidence of sapient behavior for most of that time period. Stone tools remained the same for tens of thousands of years, meaning countless generations lived and died without any innovation. There was no art and likely no storytelling. About 50,000 years ago, a distinctly human culture emerged. The tools became more complex. Styles and methods of production changed over the course of hundreds of years rather than tens of thousands. Art, religion, and calendars were invented. From then on, change has been the only constant. Many scientists think language evolved around this time. It looks like the dawn of inner life.</p><p>Much of the disagreement on when we became human is disagreement about what makes us human. Ironically, one of our clearest quirks is the need for narrative, especially for who we are and where we came from. All cultures answer these questions. The scandal of Darwinian evolution was contravening religion to explain them by material causes—natural selection degree by degree. Instead of being created in the image of God, man and beast henceforth belonged to the same family tree. We undoubtedly share a common ancestor with other animals. But this elides the deeper question of what makes us human. We may share 99% of our DNA with <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps#:~:text=These%20three%20species%20look%20alike,98.8%20percent%20of%20their%20DNA.\">chimps</a>, but on the meaningful traits humans <em>are</em> categorically different. We have language and symbolic thought. We are native dualists who feel that, at the core, we are made of spiritual stuff. A dog has never had an existential crisis.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> More than unique, these attributes seem to be binary; an organism either has them or doesn’t. How did we evolve these defining features bit by bit? Were there times when humans were only half capable of symbolic thought? What would that even look like? This is one of the great open questions of science.</p><p>The tension between anatomical modernity 200 kya (thousand years ago) and Behavioral Modernity 50 kya permeates the study of human origins. See, for example, Michael Corballis’s <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Mind-Origins-Language-Civilization/dp/0691160945\">The Recursive Mind: The Origins of Human Language, Thought, and Civilization</a></em>. He makes the case that recursive thinking undergirds self-awareness, language, counting, and imagining the future. The whole human package tightly wound up by a single principle. But the timeline is confusing. He’s “certain” that a <em>Homo Sapien</em> from 200 kya raised today could become a lawyer, artist, or scientist without any problem. He claims there are no cognitive differences on these time scales but later spends several paragraphs detailing how, starting 40 kya, there was a flowering of culture that sure looks like the emergence of recursion, and maybe it evolved then. In some ways, it’s an optimistic ideology. <em>“Yes, there are no signs of sapience 200-40 kya, but if an early Homo Sapien were raised in the modern school system, they’d be completely normal. Evolution can’t touch the brain in a mere 200,000 years.”</em> But the flip side of that coin denigrates the human spark. It implies that in the Stone Age, things we consider fundamental simply didn’t develop. The impulse to make art and search for meaning was not always found in our species. Rather, it’s a tic of whatever environments humans have been living in over the last 50,000 years. If everyone else stopped asking existential questions—or even doodling—you would, too. Or at least a child would if raised in that barren world. Not only is it a bleak vision of human nature, but if language had evolved by 200 kya, then understanding that moment is hopeless. Time gobbles up evidence. However, if it started to emerge 50 kya, we may be able to reconstruct the story. The finishing touches of linguistic thinking could have been evolving fairly recently.</p><p>I choose to frame human origins in terms of a soul. This essay’s subtitle could be <em>“How humans evolved an irreducible self-referential ‘I’,”</em> but that would divorce my project from thousands of years of thinkers and the grounding power of natural language. The meaning of <em>“soul”</em> is an agreement between millions of people about the essence of a self, the seat of agency, and connection to the divine. When grappling with what it means to be human, common language offers a guardrail.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> And in this case, a target for what must be explained. Where did souls come from?</p><p>Given that and the reference to Eve, I should clarify the relationship to Christianity. I think that Genesis and many other creation myths are remarkably good phenomenological accounts of the first man to think, “I am.” Based on the archeological and genetic data, this may have happened about 50 kya. Comparative mythologists tell us some stories have lasted that long, and if any story would be preserved for millennia, it would be our genesis.</p><p>My thesis is that women discovered “I” first and then taught men about inner life. Creation myths are memories of when women forged humans into a dualistic species. That sounds fantastic, but we have to have evolved at some point (and it must have been fantastic). Further, weaker versions of the idea are still interesting. For example, I hold that snake venom was used in the first rituals to help communicate “I am.” Hence the snake in the garden, tempting Eve with self-knowledge. Even if those rituals do not figure in human evolution or our discovery of consciousness, it would be extraordinary if a psychedelic snake cult from the Paleolithic is remembered in Genesis as well as by the Aztecs. I’d watch that Netflix series!</p><p>In several blog posts, I have developed what it would look like to discover “I, ” how it could have been communicated to others, why women would have been the vanguard, how it could evolve by degrees, and what sort of cultural and genetic marks such a process would leave. But these arguments are scattered across posts, and in the meantime, I’ve found more supporting evidence. For example, earlier, I <a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-snake-cult-of-consciousness\">mused</a> that snake venom could have been used as a hallucinogen. It turns out that this is well documented in ritual settings, including among the architects of Western civilization. </p><p>This essay starts with a discussion of what it means to be human. This is essential to establish a common framework but, unfortunately, buries the lede. The most original research is on the worldwide Snake Cult. If you’re short on time, you could start there.

Reflecting, it found nothing but itself. Then its first word was: “This am I!” whence arose the name “I” (Aham).” <a href=\"https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117939.html\">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1</a></em></p></div><p>“I” is the beginning of many creation myths. This is made explicit in the Hindu verse quoted above. Or consider the Egyptian account where Atum rises out of the primordial ocean of chaos by saying his name. There are echoes in the Bible as well. After eating the Fruit of Knowledge, Adam and Eve became self-aware—self-conscious even—and realized their nakedness. The ability to reflect on oneself then produced alienation. Adam could no longer live in unity with God and nature. He had to leave the Garden.</p><p>The New Testament can be read as a development of this idea. John begins his gospel with a nod to Genesis: <em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Word</em> here refers to Christ, the answer to the alienation wrought by The Fall of Adam and Eve. Jesus began his ministry by claiming to be the great “I Am,” one of the Jewish names of God (<a href=\"https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-56.html\">John 8:56–59</a>). It is a passage that goes over the heads of many English readers but not his Jewish audience, who immediately took up stones to kill him. They understood the claim to be “<em>I Am God, the Self-Existing One, who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</em>.” I hope it’s not an abuse of the transitive property to say, <em>“In the beginning was the I Am.”</em></p><p>These myths teach that living started with “I,” that God is ultimately self-referential, and that this same divine spark exists within man. Beyond “I,” creation myths also cite ritual, language, and technology as what separates man from beast.</p><p>In Australia, Aboriginal legend holds that civilizing spirits brought the first people language, ritual, and technology. Thus, Dreamtime ended, and time began. Similarly, the Aztecs teach that before modern humans, there lived a race of man built of wood, lacking soul, speech, calendars, and religion. A great flood wiped out this penultimate race, and humanity only survived by temporarily transforming into fish. Clearly, these myths cannot be taken literally. However, their core has held up remarkably well. When scientists answer what makes humans unique, they point to self-awareness, language, religion, and our relationship to time and technology. Many even suppose that all of these form a tight package that can be explained by “recursive” thought. It follows that, in reality, the whole package would have evolved more or less at once.</p><p>The fact that creation myths are phenomenologically accurate doesn’t need explaining. The narrative landscape is competitive, and only the most psychologically true survive, particularly in the crowded space of cosmogony. However, details in the world’s creation myths suggest they share a common root deep in the past. In fact, they seem to hail from about the time humans first started expressing “recursive” behaviors. This opens the possibility that they aren’t accurate by accident or in spite of themselves. They could be memories of the transition to sapience.</p><h2>Recursion is useful</h2><p>Natural selection works because traits are passed down from parent to child. If a trait allows a parent to have more children, then that trait will become more common in the population. So, if the ability to digest cow’s milk or think abstract thoughts is useful, these traits will become more prevalent with each generation. Given that, what abilities does recursive thinking enable?</p><p>Recursion is a process in which a function or procedure calls itself either directly or indirectly. In other words, it's a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. This can be as simple as standing between two mirrors and looking at the reflection of the reflection of your reflection. The last reflection depends on those that came before it. The concept is widely used in computer science and mathematics for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable parts. </p><p>In computer science, a recursive function applies itself to its own output. Often, each successive application will be a sub-routine, where the input gets simpler and simpler until reaching some stop condition. If that is too technical, don’t worry. Just know that algorithmically speaking, recursion is a superpower. Consider the fractal below. The most straightforward way to store the image is to enumerate the color of each pixel. But there are lots of pixels, and because there is structure in most images, they can be stored far more efficiently with some tricks. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://qr.ae/prJyDe\">JPEG uses recursion</a> to compress images, without which the algorithm would be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/math/0302212#:~:text=Graphical%20explanation%20for%20the%20speed%20of%20the%20Fast%20Fourier%20Transform&text=For%20a%20sample%20set%20of,of%20the%20Cooley%2DTukey%20algorithm.\">orders of magnitude slower</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png\" width=\"557\" height=\"434.85087719298247\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":890,\"width\":1140,\"resizeWidth\":557,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"fractal images\",\"title\":\"fractal images\",\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"fractal images\" title=\"fractal images\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F835c7ae0-b922-4a4e-a98c-13f5040f4873_1140x890.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">\"Fractals are the architecture of nature, revealing the underlying recursive patterns that shape our world.\" - Benoît Mandelbrot</figcaption></figure></div><p>One can go one step further for this image because it is generated with a recursive process. Therefore, the image can be losslessly encoded with the few bytes required to write the recursive program that originally produced the image—<a href=\"https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Recursion_and_Fractals\">a few lines of code</a>. Not only that, but one could zoom in to any edge and see the fractal recapitulate itself forever on increasingly finer scales. Recursion is almost alchemical in producing so much from so little. In the words of the legendary computer scientist Niklaus Wirth:</p><blockquote><p><em>The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.</em></p></blockquote><p>But humans aren’t computers. How does the brain use recursion? In the 1950s, the linguist Noam Chomsky departed from the blank-slate behaviorists by positing that a Universal Grammar constrained all languages. That is, humans have an instinct for language. Just as spiders weave webs of a certain design, human cognitive hardware comes wired to learn a particular type of grammar. This isn’t grammar in the sense of how to conjugate verbs, which varies by language. Rather, Universal Grammar is a meta-rule that applies to every language due to the design of the brain. In his 2002 article \"<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.298.5598.1569\">The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?</a>\" co-authored with Marc Hauser and Tecumseh Fitch, Chomsky argued recursion was the key feature of the human language faculty. Every language uses recursion as the basis of its grammar.</p><p>As in other domains, linguistic recursion means that sentences may be parsed via self-referential subroutines. For example, the sentence “<em>Watson wrote that Holmes deduced the body was in the shed”</em> can be divided into three parts:</p><p><em>X1 = Watson wrote<br>X2 = Holmes deduced<br>X3 = the body was in the shed</em></p><p>What did Watson write? To know, one must first parse X2, which in turn requires parsing X3. There is a recursive hierarchy. The sentence’s meaning completely changes with each additional clause, which can go on indefinitely. We can prepend <em>Jane said</em> that <em>John said</em> that H<em>arold said</em> that… to X1 + X2 + X3 forever. Even though there is a finite set of words, there is no longest grammatical sentence. Recursion pries infinity out of finite building blocks. Not that we go about speaking infinitely long sentences. But in practice, it does greatly increase the complexity of ideas that can be expressed. The Universal Grammar is built on the same rule as fractals.</p><p>Astute readers may be reeling at the potential bait and switch. Just because we use <em>recursion</em> to describe all these things doesn’t mean they are the same. And that’s fair. There probably are some differences. But it’s entirely in the mainstream to lump many types of recursion. It is an active area of research to test the degree to which recursion in processing music, language, vision, or motor planning uses the same neural architecture.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> Or consider the work of psychologist and linguist Michael Corballis. Along with language, he adds several other recursive superpowers in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Mind-Origins-Language-Civilization/dp/0691160945\">The Recursive Mind: The Origins of Human Language, Thought, and Civilization</a></em>. These include the ability to introspect, count, and think about the future. As this is an imagined future, it also implies the ability to create fiction, worlds that do not exist. This is the beginning of art, spiritual life, and the human condition.</p><p>So, recursion is useful. With it, humans became culture-dependent beings with a language instinct. But more importantly, for individuals, recursion is the basis of consciousness. That dual purpose (pardon the pun) is important to remember, even though consciousness and evolutionary fitness are often treated separately.</p><h2>Recursion is essential for consciousness</h2><p>Introspection requires recursion by definition. If the self perceives itself, that is recursion. So the phrase <em>“I think, therefore I am”</em> is recursive on multiple levels. Recursive grammar connects the two phrases, and the mind is directed at itself. </p><p>Descartes reasoned that the reality of anything could be doubted, with one exception. You stretch out your hand and feel a table? Well, some have been known to hallucinate such things. It may not be there. The self is the only thing he could not reason away, for it exists by definition if there is a thinker doing the doubting. <em>\"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.\" </em></p><p>There is an even subtler layer of recursion in that phrase. “I” is recursive at rest, not just when it is perceiving itself. One way to think of this is in terms of abilities. The division between your conscious and subconscious mind is that which you can and can’t introspect, not what you are currently introspecting. Similarly, the limits of “I” can be defined by what can recursively reference itself, not whether it is performing that operation at any moment.</p><p>More sophisticated arguments can be made. Douglas Hofstadter’s classic <em>I Am a Strange Loop </em>presents the idea that “I” is a result of the same type of self-referential paradox that Gödel used to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo\">break</a>” mathematics. The paper <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19763611/\">Consciousness as recursive, spatiotemporal self-location</a> includes a dozen citations connecting recursion to consciousness, as does the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/#SelRepHigOrdThe\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry</a> on Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness. Many bright people hold that the core of what we call “living” requires recursion.</p><p>We take our relationship to duality and time for granted, but these are both built on the foundation of recursion. It’s worth trying to understand that before moving on.</p><p>Disruptions of self are also disruptions of subjective time. Diseases that affect the ego, such as Schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s, also disrupt the experience of time. Anyone can dabble in this arena by taking psychedelics which produce ego-death. Such a trip can be 15 minutes on the clock and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO9oL0cEyj0\">feel like decades</a>. A more mundane example is the flow state, which seems to draw out time.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, mental time travel—thinking about the future or past—is useful. It’s not an exaggeration to call it time travel, given you are simulating the future, which allows one to flexibly plan for it. This is different from instinctive behavior, like a squirrel burying food for the winter. In fact, humans can use mental time travel to think themselves out of instincts. Humans had followed their prey for eons. Imagine the first hunter-gatherers to settle down. They must have had some idea of the next season and reasoned that they didn’t need to follow the herds because they had planted some crops (or had some other alternative). </p><p>Living outside the moment is a new kind of alienation from the material world. Many know Joseph Campbell for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey\">Hero’s Journey</a>, the idea that there is a basic template to which all (most?) stories conform. This has been popularized as a list of actions a hero takes to transcend himself and society and then reintegrate. In Campbell’s last book, he described how all stories blossomed out of recursion:</p><blockquote><p><em>in the old creation myth from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad of that primordial Being-of-all-beings who, in the beginning, thought “I” and immediately experienced, first fear, then desire. The desire in that case was not to eat, however, but to become two, and then to procreate. And in this primal constellation of themes—first, of unity, albeit unconscious; then of a consciousness of selfhood and immediate fear of extinction; next, desire, first for another and then for union with that other—we have a set of \"elementary ideas,” to use Adolf Bastian’s felicitous term, that has been sounded and inflected, transposed, developed, and sounded again through all the mythologies of mankind through the ages. And as a constant structuring strain underlying the everlasting play of these themes, there is the primal polar tension of a consciousness of duality against an earlier, but lost, knowledge of unity that is pressing still for realization and may indeed break through, under circumstances, in a rapture of self-loss.</em></p></blockquote><p>Narrative is predicated on self-awareness. This was recognized in antiquity and further developed by the likes of Campbell and Jung in the 20th century.

I’d like to offer one more: that the driving recursive thought was <em>“I am.”</em> </p><p>Describing this epiphany brings to mind a group of blind men feeling an elephant, declaring it consists of tree-trunk legs, ivory spears, or flaps of rough skin. Like them, I will give several related models that I hope describe humans’ transit transition to sapience.</p><p>The first model draws from Freud, dividing the psyche into id, ego, and superego. The id is basic animal nature to meet physical needs. The first bacteria must have had something like this: navigate towards a comfortable salinity. In humans, this is expanded to food, sex, shelter, and the like. The superego is unique to humans. It is your model of society’s expectations. What others—whether abstracted as “society” or particularly people such as <em>mother</em> or <em>chief</em>—expect. The ego is also unique to humans and mediates between these two often contradictory forces. This implies that it evolved after the superego.</p><p>Theory of Mind preceded recursive self-awareness. Before recursion, the superego was made up of models of how others would behave and expect, just as it is now. However, a pre-recursive ego is a different beast: a proto-ego. The proto-ego, too, was a model of mind (in this case, one’s own). As a mediator, it would have been well connected to both the superego and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoception\">interoceptive</a> system, keeping track of the body’s needs (an important part of the id). The first “I am” corresponds to the ego becoming self-referential, receiving itself as input. The self finally perceived the self.</p><p>In other words, we built a map of our mind, and the map became the territory “I.” Or, as Joscha Bach put it, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrPMVMb-Uw\">We exist inside the story that the brain tells itself.</a>” This suggests a straightforward answer to the ancient question of what language has to do with consciousness. Consciousness requires self-reference, which in turn allows full grammatical language. Both come from recursion. (It’s worth noting words existed before full grammatical language or self-reflection. Adam named the animals while in Eden, after all.) </p><p>One shortcoming of this model is that it makes the transition seem like the emergence of a thing, the ego. It’s more rightly understood as discovering a new space or dimension. My favorite analogy is thousands of years old and common to many religions. With recursion, humans evolved a new eye that can perceive symbolic space. A Third Eye, if you will. Just as our eyes allow us to see the electromagnetic spectrum, this new self-referential architecture in our brain allows us to perceive the symbolic realm. The abstract world of art, math, (Platonic) ideals, and the future. </p><p>Richard Dawkins said there were two great evolutionary moments. The first was the emergence of DNA, which marked the beginning of biological evolution. The second was the emergence of memes. Just as genes propagate themselves by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain. We receive ideas, refine or mutate them, and pass them on. Over the long run, the best ideas win. At this point, humans are wholly dependent on the highly evolved memes distributed over countless human brains (and now books and computers). The memetic universe is our natural habitat to a much greater degree than the material world. This is what it means to “exist inside the story the brain tells itself.” A brain that can produce such an “I” has a privileged view of the memetic universe. We are the only species that can “see” most memes—that is, hold and perceive abstract or symbolic ideas. The first person to think <em>“I am”</em> was, in a very real sense, stumbling into a new dimension. Since then, we have built castles in the sky and on earth as well. Humans reign supreme in the material world because we are the sole natives of the memetic niche.</p><p>The final model I present is the one that led me down this rabbit hole to begin with. Many scientists say language has evolved in the last 100,000 years. Why, then, is the inner voice such a core feature of conscious thought? How has language been so fully integrated into thinking if <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-blindsight-answers-the-hard-problem-of-consciousness\">consciousness goes back a hundred million years</a>?</p><p>Consider the thought experiment: what did the first inner voice say? In <a href=\"https://vectors.substack.com/p/consequences-of-conscience\">Consequences of Conscience</a>, I reasoned that, given the social nature of our species, the first inner voice may have been a moral injunction like <em>“Share your food!”</em> But the content does not matter so much. It could also have said <em>“Run!”</em> when one of our ancestors’ unconscious noticed that the birds had gone too quiet all of a sudden. The question is, would she have identified with the first inner voice? I think not. Identity is complex and requires recursion. Hallucination does not and is <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/74V5-HNXN-JEY5-DG7W?journalCode=icaa\">still common</a>. This suggests reframing <em>“When did recursion first evolve?” </em>as<em> “When did humans first identify with their inner voice?”</em></p><p>While writing a piece on inner voices (Consequences of Conscience), I struggled to convey the phenomenological significance of this moment. It struck me that I could do no better than Genesis, which reads a lot like Adam being taught his inner voice is him. Before that understanding, what would the hallucinated voices of the superego have been, if not the gods, doling out advice or commands? It follows that Satan told the truth when he said Eve’s eyes would be opened and she would become as the gods.</p><p>That would necessitate Genesis hailing from the beginning of phenomenological time. Taking that idea seriously has all the hallmarks of a wild flight of fancy. But I think mostly by convention. Fundamentally, the question is how long information can be preserved in myth and how long ago humans first demonstrated inner life. Surprisingly, there is strong evidence that myths can survive from about the time humans started doing anything that indicates recursive thoughts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no scientifically-minded person has tried to put two and two together in a very long time. That is this fool’s errand.</p><h2>Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC)</h2><p>Whether Genesis could be a cultural memory of the discovery of the human condition comes down to two questions:</p><ol><li><p>How long can a myth last?</p></li><li><p>When did we become human?</p></li></ol><p>If those are about the same length, then Genesis could be a memory of our genesis. Both questions are difficult but not totally intractable. I write about the first question <a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/evidence-for-global-cultural-diffusion\">here</a>, giving several examples of global memes that were first evidenced about 30,000 years ago. For statistical reasons, the simplest example is the Seven Sisters. In dozens of cultures from Greece to Australia to North America, the Pleiades star cluster is said to represent Seven Sisters, even though only six stars are visible. The discrepancy is often a plot point in the story: a missing sister. Given this detail, Seven Sisters myths worldwide must share a common root. It’s not a plot that would independently emerge.</p><p>The seven stars are painted on cave walls in France 21 kya and Australia in the mid-Holocene, where they are also part of the Dreamtime creation myth. Most researchers interpret this to mean the myth is around 100,000 years old. As I’ll explain later, there is no need to posit anything much more than 30,000 years. In large part because, in relation to question 2, there is no compelling evidence of recursive thinking (including fiction) before Behavioral Modernity 40-50 kya. That transition is debated, which we will return to. But for now, all that needs to be established is that there is considerable overlap between mainstream estimates of 1 and 2. I’ll outline a weak and strong version of how recursive culture could have spread. Starting with the weak, which does not rely on any religious text, and then moving to the strong, which interprets common details of creation myths as meaningful.</p><h3>Weak EToC</h3><p>Humans today have a fairly seamless construction of self. There are cracks around the edges, particularly if you do drugs, meditate, or have schizophrenia. But many get through life taking “I” for granted from the time they are about 18 months old. In the beginning, this would not have been the case. Recursive loops are inherently unstable. There are steady configurations, but it’s unlikely our cognitive wiring lept from no recursion to recursion as a load-bearing infinite loop without significant evolution. This would take generations of natural selection for the seamless construction of self at a young age.</p><p>It’s instructive to imagine the first person to think, “I am.” Modern humans become self-aware as toddlers, it seems. They can at least use “I” correctly, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/are-babies-conscious-13628\">pass a mirror test</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474569125/your-brain-on-lsd-looks-a-lot-like-a-babys\">brain scans no longer look like they’re on an acid trip</a>. My guess is the first sapient person was not a toddler because they aren’t particularly introspective or good with Theory of Mind. In that case, the first sapient person would have been an adult who had lived their life up until that moment in non-reflective unity. Let’s call her Eve. It’s possible that she was either pregnant or going through puberty when she had the realization, as those are periods of great brain reorganization, particularly related to social cognition. At any rate, once “I am” was obtained by adults or adolescents, selection for recursion would mean developing “I” younger and younger. Eventually, this drove the age down to ~18 months.</p><p>There also would have been selection for more functional recursion. By this, I don’t mean more intelligent or better at grammar, though that is part of it. The clearest lens is phenomenological. The evolution of a soul opens up the whole spirit world, much of which is haunted. The first humans would have been far more schizophrenic, not knowing exactly where “I” started and other imagined specters began. Hallucinating voices is the best-known symptom, but schizophrenia also includes a loss of sense of agency and a feeling that one’s body (or some part) does not belong to them. Go back far enough, and this would have been the norm. And farther still, there would be no “owner” at all. There is a spectrum of how smoothly recursion runs as the default mode. Modern disruptions like epilepsy or schizophrenia map onto that spectrum but are minor compared to the variation that existed in the past. The first thousand light bulbs were extremely faulty by today’s standards. The same is true of the light of consciousness. <a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/i/114650037/men-follow-in-the-holocene\">As I’ve written before</a>, the intermediate evolutionary period could be called the Valley of Insanity. The longer recursion took to evolve, the more time humans spent as Homo Schizo.</p><p>The first thousand people to have thought “I am” may have lost that train of thought and gone on living in unity with the universe. If they had such a concept, “altered states of consciousness” would have referred to duality—ego birth, not ego death. Imagine the first person for whom “I am” stuck for any length of time. What would it be like to explain the situation to the rest of the tribe? Absolute lunacy. Like describing the taste of “salt” to a silicon-based alien who only speaks Spanish. Nobody understood the first Eve, and the evolutionary meat grinder kept churning. Given recursion is devilishly useful, those who tended to have the “I” epiphany may have also tended to be better at other (proto-)recursive tasks, such as social navigation or counting, causing them to have more children. Even a small correlation between “I” and these tasks would be sufficient for a temporary experience of “I” to be more common hundreds of generations after the first epiphany. And there likely was a correlation, given the extent to which the brain uses recursive networks for many tasks. </p><p>At some point, critical mass would be reached. Enough people would experience “I”—though perhaps only sporadically—to build a culture around it. This would create a steep fitness gradient for those who can participate in recursive culture. In other words, the less-recursive folks died or had fewer kids. Consider all the ways, over many thousands of years:</p><ol><li><p>Language becomes recursive, with it, the jokes around the campfire, instructions on making an ax, and the endless small-tribe gossip.</p></li><li><p>Shamanism and the entire spiritual plane are only appreciated by those who can experience duality.</p></li><li><p>More sophisticated deceit requires recursion. With duality, one must learn to wear a mask. Everyone else is a sitting duck to the social technology of saying one thing and meaning another.</p></li><li><p>Recursion changes one’s relationship with time, allowing more flexible planning for the future. This is expressed in language with past and future tenses, further complicating grammar.</p></li><li><p>Music and dance <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/music-in-human-evolution/\">use recursive structures</a>.</p></li></ol><p>This selection process could have happened fairly quickly. Let’s say <em>“seamless construction of self”</em> is about as heritable as schizophrenia (~50%) and is correlated r = 0.1 with fitness (surviving number of children). This is fairly conservative, as nowadays <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1390257\">people with schizophrenia only have about 50% as many children</a> (a huge fitness penalty). The law of the Paleolithic jungle may have been even harsher on those with a fractured grip on reality.</p><p>Plugging those conservative parameters into the <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27199#:~:text=R%20%3D%20h2%20S.,workhorse%20equation%20for%20quantitative%20genetics.\">Breeder Equation</a>, recursive ability (uninterrupted function and acquisition at younger ages) could increase one standard deviation every 20 generations or ~500 years.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> Here is how far recursion would shift in a population over 2,000 or 5,000 years:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png\" width=\"591\" height=\"397.6346863468635\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":547,\"width\":813,\"resizeWidth\":591,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ff8996-e632-4aa1-932e-4e0b17a45b3b_813x547.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The bell curves represent the recursive ability of populations at 0 years, 2,000 years, and 5,000 years.

That is, those with a seamless construction of self need to have ever slightly more children than those who do not. That seems perfectly reasonable. A correlation of r = 0.1 is barely perceptible in real life, and there are advantages to recursive thinking. Remember, Dawkins said the emergence of memes is one of two great evolutionary moments. Only recursive thinkers could access that great well of knowledge. The ability to understand recursive culture is completely overpowered as a strategy to pass on one’s genes. In the last 50,000 years, we have used this tool to conquer the world, driving many species to extinction and enjoying exponential population growth along the way. Who was having more kids then? Those who were marginally better at recursion. It’s hard to imagine a scenario where there wasn’t selection in that time period.</p><p>So, when I say “evolutionary time scales,” I mean long enough to have no overlap between the recursive abilities of two populations. Long enough to be cognitively foreign. Tribes where men develop consciousness as infants vs. during puberty or have schizophrenia rates of 1% vs. 10%. It turns out that may be as short as a few thousand years. And this estimate is well within the bounds of mainstream answers. In fact, Noam Chomsky says it took just one generation.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language#Chomsky's_single-step_theory\">Chomsky</a> and another linguist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language#The_Romulus_and_Remus_hypothesis\">Andrey Vyshedskiy</a> have both proposed theories where a single mutation 50-100 kya enabled recursion, and we are all descendants of that fortunate forbear. This solves the question of degrees (it was a single gene, like a light switch) and scraps the Valley of Insanity. It is also almost certainly wrong. Recursive functions are liable to be unstable, so it would be a great surprise if that were worked out in one fell swoop. Thousands of genes influence schizophrenia and language ability. The evolution of inner life must implicate just as many. Moreover, we have now sequenced the genes of millions of people, including hundreds of prehistoric humans. In the words of population geneticist David Reich, if there was a <em>“single critical genetic change,”</em> it is<em> “running out of places to hide.” </em>Much of what I write is speculative, but I don’t see a way to get around the transition to sapience being very psychologically strange. There must have been a time when inner life was far more fractured. Once recursion started to evolve, it was such a competitive advantage that it would have made up for any fitness loss, including unpleasant side effects like demonic possession and cluster headaches, which would have been passed along with it. Often, human self-domestication is discussed in terms of becoming more <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/early-humans-had-to-become-more-feminine-before-they-could-dominate-the-planet-42952\">pro-social and feminine</a>. Yes, but I think the steepest selection gradient must have been for the “seamless construction of self.” A cleanly delineated “I” and feeling as though one is in control of one’s body. And for this to develop young.</p><p>This is a model of <em>what</em> was evolving, now let’s consider the <em>when</em>.

The reasoning is that these are cultural universals among living humans, so they must go back to our genetic root. Branches of humanity have been separated for 300,000 years, so art must go back at least to then. As the article puts it:</p><blockquote><p><em>“We inherited our humanity from peoples in southern Africa 300,000 years ago. The alternative – that everyone, everywhere coincidentally became fully human in the same way at the same time, starting 65,000 years ago – isn’t impossible, but a single origin is more likely.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This is simply not true, given culture can spread. If recursive culture diffused at the cusp of sapience, it would change the fitness landscape wherever it went. Non-recursive or semi-recursive people could have evolved into the memetic niche in the subsequent thousands of years. It’s also wrong about genetic isolation. Humanity’s most recent common ancestor—the most recent person everyone alive is related to—is much more recent than 300 kya. <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-are-all-more-closely-related-than-we-commonly-think/\">Scientific American cites studies</a> that estimate this to be just 2-7 kya. Genes get around. If there were genes important for recursion, they could have spread starting 50 kya. In the footnote, I go into other problems with the 300 kya date.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> But I don’t want to spend too much time on it. The purpose of this essay is to separate our cultural and genetic roots. Recursive culture could spread and then cause selection for modern human cognition. In theory, this could happen even without genetic contact between groups.</p><p>This anthropologist’s framing embeds another common assumption: humans must have been fully human from the moment there is evidence of art or other modern behavior. But the point I have been trying to hammer home is that it would have taken time for recursion to evolve. The first person to think “I am” was not like us. Nor were the first artists 40 kya. If we were to establish a trans-temporal adoption agency, children from 40 kya would not grow up to be lawyers, doctors, or engineers. They would be conscious, but in a modern city would very well end up institutionalized. Evolving something as subtle as a Third Eye takes time.</p><p>The best way to understand when humans came online is to look at the archeological record, and for evidence of natural selection in our genomes. Starting with archeology, the date 65 kya used in the graphic is quite generous.

Most poignantly, these may have been self-portraits, which is about the art one would expect to be produced with the discovery of “I.” Moreover, at about this time, all over the world, one can find sure examples of recursion. As mentioned earlier, counting requires recursion. The oldest tally stick dates back <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick\">44 kya in South Africa</a>. Notably, there are 28 notches, and it has been suggested that this was made by a woman to keep track of her menstrual cycle, though it could also have been the lunar cycle. Tracking these cycles is one of the first technologies one would expect to develop with the discovery of subjective time. Finally, Indonesia is home to the oldest known narrative art, a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/45000-year-old-pig-painting-indonesia-may-be-oldest-known-animal-art-180976748/\">cave painting dated 45 kya</a>. Like other early examples of recursion, there is a connection to women. Much of the earliest cave art is of hand prints. The digit ratios indicate that <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art\">women left three-quarters of these</a>.</p><p>These artifacts tick all the recursive boxes: counting, art, storytelling, and interest in selfhood, duality, and time. In the literature, this transition is referred to as Behavioral Modernity. The idea that our minds took their now-current form 40-20 kya was <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335216046_Behavioral_Modernity_in_Retrospect\">dominant up until the 1990s</a>. For example, the current curator of paleoanthropology at the Harvard Peabody Museum wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The time between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago saw the spread of modern man out of his hypothetical \"Garden of Eden\" until, through a process of swamping and replacing older and more archaic subspecies of H. sapiens, he inherited the earth.” ~ </em>The Ascent of Man, David Pilbeam</p></blockquote><p><em>Ascent</em> was written in 1972 and reprinted in 1991, not all that long ago. As recently as 2009, psychologist Frederick L. Coolidge and anthropologist Thomas Wynn wrote: <em>“The most parsimonious interpretation is that modern executive functions did not emerge much earlier than 32,000 years ago.”</em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><p>However, in the last several decades, evidence of deep genetic splits within Africa has complicated this view, and more inclusive definitions of humanity (<a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/i/114632067/years-ago-sodomy-in-the-uncanny-valley\">sometimes without recursive language</a>) have become popular. But again, one of the advantages of EToC is that it allows for separate genetic and memetic roots for humanity. Demonstrating deep genetic splits does not mean that someone 300,000 years ago had the genetic endowment for recursion, much less stable recursion.</p><p>Most readers are probably aware of the transition to Behavioral Modernity 40-50 kya. Less well-known is that transition was a process. The cultural level reached in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02294-4\">Eurasia 40 kya</a> was not achieved worldwide until much later. For example, a <a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1386&context=scipapers#:~:text=This%20review%20finds%20that%20the,the%20origin%20of%20modern%20behaviour\">2005 paper</a> argues that hallmarks of the symbolic revolution are only evidenced in Australia in the last 7,000 years.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> Further, before the Holocene (12 kya), the Australian cultural toolkit most closely resembles Europe and Africa in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic (3,300-300 kya and 300-30kya, respectively). In other words, the tools were millions of years out of date. In evolutionary time, this was before <em>Homo Sapiens</em> or Neanderthals, or Denisovans even existed. <em>Homo Erectus</em> called, and he wants his stone tools back.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-11\" href=\"#footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a> (It’s important to note that the authors use this to argue <em>against</em> Behavioral Modernity. They don’t think it represents a significant evolutionary change, given its recency.)</p><p>More broadly, the archeologist Colin Renfrew proposed the Sapient Paradox, which asks: <em>If humans have been cognitively modern for 50k, 100k, or 300k years, why isn’t modern behavior widespread until roughly the end of the Ice Age?</em> According to Renfrew, <em>“From a distance and to the non-specialist anthropologist, the Sedentary Revolution [12 kya] looks like the true Human Revolution.”</em></p><p>He is not alone. Michael Corballis presents two possible periods for the evolution of recursion: 400-200 kya and 40-10 kya.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-12\" href=\"#footnote-12\" target=\"_self\">12</a> Just last year, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-did-humans-first-start-to-speak-how-language-evolved-in-africa-194372\">linguist George Poulos argued</a> that <em>“language, as we know it today, probably began to emerge about 20,000 years ago.”</em> Likewise, linguists Antonio Benítez-Burraco and Ljiljana Progovac <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271530920300288\">propose a four-stage model</a> for the evolution of language, with recursion only present in the last 10,000 years. By their analysis, it was not until then that humans demonstrated behavior complex enough to need recursive language. In addition to social complexity, they point to the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aao5961\">global shift to a more globular skull shape</a> in the last 35,000 years. It’s a quirk of the term “Anatomically Modern Human.” This is applied to humans 200 kya, but it doesn’t mean <em>“could pass for a modern human.”</em> It means <em>“has features like a gracile skeleton and a reduced brow ridge that are now common to humans and distinguish us from extinct members of the genus Homo.”</em> Our skulls are not the same as even 50 kya!</p><p>If there were a rewiring of the brain for recursion in the last 50 kya, then one would expect:</p><ol><li><p>Changes in skull shape</p></li><li><p>Lots of new genetic mutations related to cognition</p></li></ol><p>As previously mentioned, skulls were <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/early-humans-had-to-become-more-feminine-before-they-could-dominate-the-planet-42952\">becoming more feminine</a> and globular in this period. Turning to the second question, the paper <em><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.05.525539v1\">Genetic timeline of human brain and cognitive traits</a></em> is instructive.

Like the archeological record, not much is going on 200 kya. When does it look like we entered a new niche and encountered new problems that required new genetic material to solve?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png\" width=\"589\" height=\"436.08653846153845\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":616,\"width\":832,\"resizeWidth\":589,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5c6ba3-a352-420e-a42f-690932158e01_832x616.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Human-phenotypic SNPs are genes (technically, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism\">Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms</a>) that are related to traits in modern humans, including cognitive and psychiatric traits (e.g., intelligence, smoking cessation).

They suggest these are adaptations to handle the relatively colder environment of Saudi Arabia as humans left Africa:</p><blockquote><p><em>“While neurological functions initially appear surprising, it is possible that this observation mostly relates to the critical role the nervous system and brain play in coordinating, integrating, and subsequently regulating diverse physiological processes, which are impacted by cold environments.”</em></p></blockquote><p>One wonders if Saudi Arabia was cold enough to cause such significant changes in brain function.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-13\" href=\"#footnote-13\" target=\"_self\">13</a> They also mention that, “provocatively,” it could indicate cognitive evolution for sociality.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-14\" href=\"#footnote-14\" target=\"_self\">14</a> (And I would add recursion, which is first evidenced around this time.)</p><p>So, the weak version of EToC is that recursive culture spread and changed the fitness landscape. Recursion was not always evenly distributed over the world, but a rough timeline is that there were moments of duality 50-100 kya<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-15\" href=\"#footnote-15\" target=\"_self\">15</a>, and recursion was “put to work” 50 kya when it was psychologically integrated enough to begin building culture around recursive skills. Given recursion is found all across the world soon after, this culture must have spread. At that time, “I” was not necessarily a constant, uninterrupted fixture. Individual’s relationship with their inner voice could have been wildly different. At some point, perhaps fairly recently, the seamless construction of self became the norm worldwide, and disruptions are now pathologized.</p><p>The bulk of selection would have been in the last 50,000 years. How could there have been selection for symbolic thinking before there was symbolic culture? Selection would have happened little by little at first. It must have started with barely recursive humans producing barely recursive culture. Perhaps this was a stable equilibrium for some time, given all of the problems recursion causes. At a certain point of cultural complexity, recursive thinking would become table stakes, creating a steep selection gradient.</p><p>The question of what makes us human goes back thousands of years. Most of what I present is a review. From the many competing theories I chose to emphasize recursion (rather than, say, symbolic thought) because it is a natural way to show that the human transition was both practical and phenomenological. We evolved a soul, and that allowed us to conquer the world. Most accounts of self-domestication emphasize getting along and non-aggression, the difference between wolves and dogs. For humans, however, the change has been categorical. <em>Homo Sapiens</em> means “Thinking Man.” Non-recursive humans were not sapient. Their relationship with time and the material world is as different from ours as water is from ice. Humans are absolutely singular as a species. This isn’t really a contribution, as it’s been said for thousands of years. My contribution is how I think this transition could have played out over evolutionary time scales. Also noteworthy is that my (very incomplete) model of what makes humans special is not required for the rest. If you don’t agree with recursion, substitute “symbolic thinking,” “language,” “higher-order thinking,” or your preferred definition of “soul.” The only real requirement is that it is a phase change.</p><p>Many researchers think something biological changed ~50 kya, and language (or recursion) is on the shortlist. Where I diverge somewhat is the emphasis on the gene-culture interaction and how long the process could have taken. Even if there were moments of sapience 50 kya, fully modern psychology could have been obtained much later. The weak version of EToC posits that “recursive culture” spread in the last 50,000 years. To defend that idea, it’s easiest to say exactly what that was. The strong version of EToC holds that women, by and large, first understood “I am.” Later, they developed psychedelic snake rituals to aid in that epiphany, and those rituals spread. The male perspective is preserved in many creation myths, including Genesis. This is why I emphasized the phenomenological implications of recursion. Stories worth retelling concern changes in consciousness, not technology. Therefore, if recursion evolved within the reach of oral tradition, what would be passed down with the most reverence are the changes to do with time, self-awareness, agency, and duality. Not utilitarian concerns of more complex grammar or stone tools (though their introduction is also remembered).</p><h1>The Snake Cult of Consciousness</h1><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png\" width=\"422\" height=\"838.092\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":993,\"width\":500,\"resizeWidth\":422,\"bytes\":1062281,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F676711d5-70f0-462e-9a34-d33bd7afb44b_500x993.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/412181\">The Serpent</a>, plate 5 of the series Eve and the Future, Opus III, 1880, Max Klinger</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"pullquote\"><p><em>“And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.

Once Eve perceived herself as an agent and the voice in her head as her own, she could no longer dwell in blissful ignorance. She became responsible for her actions and aware of her mortality. Others have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RP4SIYw1YA\">offered this interpretation</a>. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/\">Julian Jaynes</a> even related it to identifying with the inner voice. But what’s with the snake?</p><p>If you took a time machine to visit humans at the cusp of recursion, could you teach them about “I”? What would you try? I would embed “I” into a horror ritual. An escape room where the only way out was in. This would pull on many biological levers, including psychedelics, given their ability to help <a href=\"https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/\">change one’s mind</a>. The acute effects include opening the mind and enabling novel thoughts. Particularly affected are functions related to introspection and consciousness. </p><p>It’s a bit odd that a class of drugs known most for ego death could be involved with ego birth. But the proposed mechanism is more a “brain reset” during which an initiate has many new ideas—hopefully including “I am”—followed by weeks of increased brain plasticity where those can be integrated. This is not my idea. Terence McKenna proposed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoned_ape_theory\">Stoned Ape Theory</a> in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Gods-Original-Knowledge-Evolution/dp/0553371304\">Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge</a></em>.</p><p>For McKenna, the relationship between consciousness and psychedelics was practical. When he tripped, he saw consciousness being constructed in his mind. One of his most eloquent expositions is on entities he described as self-transforming machine elves—fantastical creatures made of language. <em>“I don't know why there should be an invisible syntactical intelligence giving language lessons in hyperspace. That certainly, consistently, seems to be what is happening.”</em>  Based on his schooling in hyperspace, he figured that language was fundamental to consciousness and that psychedelics could help in obtaining it. </p><p>McKenna argued the Food of the Gods was psilocybin mushrooms. But they only play a minor role in religious history. In fact, a much better candidate is in Genesis itself: snakes.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-16\" href=\"#footnote-16\" target=\"_self\">16</a> Their venom is a psychedelic that contains large amounts of nerve growth factor.

It took my life away, but it gave me something more precious than life.\" ~Sadhguru, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyoL8tjB_hc&t=156s\">“Why I drank snake venom”</a></em></p></div><p>In the 1970s, the classicist Carl Ruck coined the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen#:~:text=Thus%2C%20the%20term%20entheogen%2C%20derived,to%20the%20%22divine%20within.%22\">entheogen</a> (literally, “god within”) to refer to hallucinogens used to induce altered states of consciousness. Importantly, this is not just any alteration; they must be used to access the “divine within.” Most cultures seem to have at least one entheogen of choice, be that opium, cannabis, coca-leaves, iboga root, salvia, ayahuasca, psilocybin mushrooms, betel nut, acacia, or bufo toad, to name a few. Often left off this list is snake venom. A glaring hole in the literature I aim to address here.</p><p>The first question is chemical. Can snake venom function as an entheogen? There are a few papers—enough to merit a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968650/\">review article</a>—on snake venom as a recreational drug. The case reports are similar to those of psilocybin mushrooms. In one, the venom is intravenously delivered from fang to tongue by the neighborhood snake charmer. With a single dose, the patient reports changing long-ingrained behaviors. Following a decade of dependence on alcohol and opiates, he gave both up cold turkey after one kiss of the cobra. Vice also has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTJNcBKLc8\">mini-doc about the phenomenon in India</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q_m-rDUNw0&t=532s\">one-off case</a> in the UK.</p><p>Psychedelics <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01316-5\">stimulate the production of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)</a>, which allows for greater brain plasticity. Therefore, if you want to Change Your Mind, as Michael Pollen <a href=\"https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/\">puts it</a>, then psychedelics are an excellent tool. The medical field is currently in a psychedelic boom where these drugs are being tested to treat pretty much any psychiatric issue.</p><p>Snake venom does more than just stimulate the production of NGF; it brings its own to the party. In the 1950s, laboratories sourced NGF from brain tumors in mice. When snake venom was used to process the tumors, the resulting NGF was much more effective. Upon investigation, the researchers found that snake venom by itself contains NGF <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.42.9.571\">3,000-6,000 times as potent</a> as that derived from tumors, the previous best source.</p><p>The induced plasticity is not just acute, nor solely to do with NGF. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jnc.15196\">One recent paper</a> argues that snake venom could be a cornerstone of treatment in neurodegenerative diseases: <em>“a component of the Indian Cobra N. naja</em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-17\" href=\"#footnote-17\" target=\"_self\">17</a><em> venom with no significant similarity to nerve growth factor, is shown to induce sustained neuritogenesis [growth of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurite\">connections</a> between neurons].” </em>It is currently being <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jnc.15196\">researched</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143417917302184\">treat</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-020-02270-0\">Alzheimer’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)85735-4/fulltext\">Disease</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987722001505\">depression</a>. This is heartening, but modern medicine is young yet. Most of the potential <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6215107/\">remains unknown</a>. One <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/11/10/564\">recent paper</a> put it: <em>“snake venoms can be considered as mini-drug libraries in which each drug is pharmacologically active. However, less than 0.01% of these toxins have been identified and characterized.”</em></p><p>There is the question of delivery. I’m not sure if NGF is bioavailable when injected on the tongue or taken orally mixed with milk, as Sadhguru did. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01241-w\">This paper</a> finds the tongue is an excellent location to pass the blood-brain barrier (even without injection). But there is more than one way to skin a cat and even more to puff the magic dragon. Classicist David Hillman suggests snake venom concoctions were administered as anal suppositories at Greek temples. Delivery does not seem to be a limiting factor.</p><p>The final criterion is whether venom is ritualized in a spiritual setting. There are dozens of YouTube videos of the Hindu guru Sadhguru discussing why he drank snake venom. In his words:</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p><em>“Venom has a significant impact on one’s perception if you know how to make use of it…It brings a separation between you and your body… It is dangerous because <strong>it may separate you for good.</strong>” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROTibYc4irk\">The Unknown Secret of how Venom works on your body [practical experience]</a> </em></p></div><p>Venom’s spiritual use is not limited to one guru. The next sections will look at the mythological and archeological evidence around the world. This is organized in an ever-expanding radius: proto-Indo-European, Eurasia and America, and then worldwide.</p><h2>Proto Indo European</h2><div class=\"pullquote\"><p><em>“Serpents were milked to

href=\"https://archive.org/details/essayonmysteries00uvar/page/n25/mode/2up\">Essay on the Mysteries of Eleusis</a></em>, published 1817</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Romans copy-pasted as much of Greek culture as they could. Looking back at that effort, the Roman orator Cicero waxed eloquent about the Eleusinian Mysteries:</p><blockquote><p><em>“For it appears to me that among the many exceptional and divine things your Athens has produced and contributed to human life, nothing is better than those Mysteries. <strong>For by means of them we have been transformed from a rough and savage way of life to the state of humanity, and have been civilized.</strong> Just as they are called initiations, so in actual fact we have learned from them the fundamentals of life, and have grasped the basis not only for living with joy, but also for dying with a better hope.” </em>M. Tullius Cicero, De Legibus, ed. Georges de Plinval, Book 2.14.36</p></blockquote><p>The Eleusinian Mysteries were the quintessential Greek celebration of death and rebirth. They told the story of Persephone’s abduction to the underworld and the grief-stricken search by her mother, Demeter, for her return. At the heart of this tale was said to be the secret of life. Or, in the words of the Greek poet Pindar,<em> “Blessed is he who, having seen these rites, goes beneath the hollow earth; for he knows the end of life, and he knows its god-sent beginning.”</em> What was revealed about the beginning of life is, well, a mystery. It was a mystery cult, and the punishment for revealing their secrets was death. But even more, words do not seem adequate for the task. Homer, not one to be at a loss for words, nevertheless demurs in his description: <em>“Great awe of the gods makes the voice falter.” </em>What happened at Eleusis had to be experienced to be understood.</p><p>Still, there are some hints. In 1978 Ruck’s <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2402353.The_Road_to_Eleusis\">The Road to Eleusis</a></em> scandalized the field of classics by making a case that the core of the initiation was psychedelic. Brian Muraresku revisited that argument in his recent best-seller <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Immortality-Key-Uncovering-History-Religion/dp/1250207142\">The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name</a></em>. (Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf_CJ7stwI\">Sam Harris’s interview</a>.) Muraresku interprets the promise <em>“If you die before you die, you won’t die when you die</em>” as a reference to ego death induced by fungus. As an engineer, I think of these possibilities in mechanical terms. Psychedelics are a powerful cognitive tool. It’s not surprising that the most powerful religious technology enlisted their charms. Still, there are better candidates for the entheogen at Eleusis.</p><p>In the second century AD, the emperor Marcus Aurelius was initiated into the Mysteries. He is reportedly the only lay person ever allowed inside the holy of holies within the main temple. As emperor, he rebuilt the temple after it was nearly destroyed by the barbarian Kostovoks in AD 170. His bust rests in the courtyard, with a snake emblazoned on his chest.</p><p>Aeschylus, the father of Greek tragedy, was also an initiate, and many of his plays dealt with the Mysteries. In one, he seems to have flown too close to the sun and was almost executed for revealing too much. Consider Hillman’s <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128153390000238\">interpretation</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Before ancient seers summoned spirits like Allecto from the underworld—an arcane practice known as necromancy—they invoked Bacchus, the god of ecstatic dance. The worship of this mystery cult divinity, known variously as Dionysus, Bromius, and Zagreus, was connected in classical literature and art with the handling of the European horned viper (Vipera ammodytes)...It appears that the priestesses of Hecate, Priapus, and Demeter/ Persephone were involved in the consumption of viper venom. [Aeschylus was nearly executed for revealing the secrets of the Eleusinian mysteries in his plays on Orestes. One of these plays (The Cup-bearers) contains a dream of a “dragoness” in which her breast milk is injected with the venom of a snake.]...Some of them are even called “dragonesses,” and are involved with the “burning off” of human mortality.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The playwright Aristophanes also profaned the mysteries, which Hillman connects to snake venom in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128153390000263\">another paper</a> that discusses the dragonesses/drakaina:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The Drakaina, or δρακαινα , was said to bring about her powers by mixing/preparing drugs in potable or consumable form. There are numerous named Drakainai, among the most famous being Clytemnestra. Aristophanes was accused of profaning (revealing) the Mysteries in his trilogy on Orestes. In his Libation Bearers, Aeschylus records that the Drakaina produced and administered a mixture of blood and milk after being bitten in the breast by a snake/dragon (514 ff.) Orestes even describes his own “snakeification” or transformation into the Dragon. (Line 549: ἐκδρακοντωθεὶς δ᾽ ἐγὼ, “I myself too have brought out the dragon.”)</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>Dragon priestesses entered an ecstatic or Bacchic state of mania, during which they claimed to experience and influence transdimensional forces or “daimones” (demons) by manipulating “waves” of timespace distortions produced by “darkened stars.” The Greeks used the word ἔνθεος [entheos, literally “god within”] to describe this strange star-induced ecstasy, and <strong>mystics claimed it was part of a process of manifesting the “god within the breast” of the initiate.</strong>”</em></p></blockquote><p>This was the subject of his dissertation. He explicitly states that the Mysteries used snake venom as an entheogen, and he provides dozens of primary references.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-18\" href=\"#footnote-18\" target=\"_self\">18</a> Still, it’s nice to have a second opinion, this one about the oracle at Delphi (where the high priestess was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia\">called the </a><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia\">Pythoness</a></em>):</p><blockquote><p><em>“The Sioux believed that if a young, dancing man was bitten by a snake and didn’t die, he would experience a universal awakening. (Since ancient times, dancing was felt to be an ecstatic mimesis of the mystical and is still seen as the means by which mysteries are disclosed.) Snake venom was lapped to induce trances at Delphi. Even some scientists testify to experiencing altered states from snakebite, seeing visions and feeling enormous capabilities.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Snake-Animal-Drake-Stutesman/dp/186189239X\">Drake Stutesman, Snake, 2005</a></p></blockquote><p>We will return to snake dances. For now, the fact that Ancient Greeks used venom as an entheogen appears to be common knowledge among at least a subfield of classicists.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-19\" href=\"#footnote-19\" target=\"_self\">19</a> At least it is well-documented that various temples housed snakes.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-20\" href=\"#footnote-20\" target=\"_self\">20</a> And though it may be a salacious rumor, Clemens, an Egyptian pagan philosopher who converted to Christianity circa 200 AD, wrote that the Mysteries included snake orgies dedicated to Eve.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-21\" href=\"#footnote-21\" target=\"_self\">21</a> At any rate, given the Mysteries extend back to prehistory, it is prudent to look to sister civilizations for corroborating evidence that snake venom was used as an entheogen. </p><p>In the 1580s, the Florentine merchant <a href=\"https://nuscimagazine.com/on-the-origin-of-languages-our-proto-indo-european-roots/\">Filippo Sassetti noted</a> that the Sanskrit words for <em>God</em>, <em>serpent </em>(!), and some numbers sounded like his native Italian. So began the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) hypothesis: India and Europe were part of the same cultural stock, sharing a root deep in the past. In the subsequent centuries, no prehistoric group has been the subject of more linguistic and archeological interest. The PIE people are thought to have lived 6-9,000 years ago somewhere around the Black Sea. Their descendants have spread over much of Eurasia, taking their language, religion, and customs with them. Today <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages#:~:text=In%20total%2C%2046%25%20of%20the,highest%20of%20any%20language%20family.\">46%</a> of the world’s population is native in a PIE language. </p><p>Having established the connection, we turn from Greece to India to triangulate venom use among the PIEs. There, the potion of enlightenment is called Soma, and it, too, has mythic associations with snakes and milk. </p><blockquote><p><em>“Snakes (often symbolizing women) perform an alchemy that women perform by turning blood into milk. In the village ritual, milk is fed to a snake; the snake then turns this into poison, which in turn is rendered harmless by Soma (or by the shaman, who controls Soma, drugs and snakes). Yogis, the inverse of mothers in terms of fluid hydraulics, drink poison, which they regard as Soma, and thus have power over snakes. A yogi can also drink poison and turn it into seed, and he can turn his own seed into Soma by activating the (poisonous?) coiled serpent goddess Kundalini”</em> Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, 1980, page 54.</p></blockquote><p>Once again, snake venom and milk are symbolically mixed up with life itself. This theme pervades Indian religion. After obtaining enlightenment, the Buddha is sheltered from a storm by the Naga king. And Naga enlightenment is not a dead religion. The venom-drinking Sadhguru has millions of followers and a penchant for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=379sjCvO0Ek\">resurrecting esoteric rituals</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvJMni0GXYQ\">involving snakes</a>. There are many videos of him on YouTube discussing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwfClnhF4Vs\">ritual significance</a> in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI3K_c6CS-M\">perfect entheogenic language</a>. And, like Aeschylus, he combines snake venom with milk. I don’t think anyone has argued for a PIE tradition of snake venom Soma, even though it seems to be well documented in sacred rites in Greece and India. (Or, as we’ll discuss later, Soma could have been the antivenom consumed before the encounter with a snake.)</p><p>But my claim is not about the Proto-Indo-Europeans. It is about the world. And it is not about ego death in Ancient Greece but the evolutionary origins of ego.

The Pyramid Texts offer invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian beliefs regarding the cosmos, creation, and the gods.</p><p>Like many other traditions, Egyptians held that there was only chaos in the beginning, often represented as an ocean. Earlier, I referenced an Egyptian tradition where Atum emerged from the ocean by saying his name. This passage reflects another tradition where the first being is Neheb-ka:</p><div class=\"pullquote\"><p><em>“I am the outflow of the Primeval Flood, he who emerged from the waters.

Phylogenetic relationships between Greece and India are to be expected, given they both hail from PIE culture 6-9 kya. Going deeper in time meets many methodological issues. However, snake myths are a rare exception where much larger and deeper phylogenies are accepted. How does one square the Egyptian, Hebrew, and PIE conception of life-giving snakes with that of the Chinese, for example?

W. Buckland</a> noted the similarities of serpent worship on either side of the Bering Strait and argued that it, along with sun worship, agriculture, weaving, pottery, and metalwork, spread from Eurasia to the New World with the earliest settlers. Over a hundred years later, comparative mythologist Michael Witzel echoes the claims about snakes. He argues that a creation cosmogony was developed in Eurasia from 40-15 kya, which then spread to the New World. Drawing from traditional cultures in China, Hawaii, Meso-America, Egypt, Greece, England, Japan, Persian, and India, he proposes the proto-creation myth included the slaying of a great dragon, often with the help of a “heavenly drink” such as Soma. After completing this deed, humans were given (or stole) culture: <em>“It is only after the earth has been fertilized by the Dragon’s blood that it can support life.”</em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-23\" href=\"#footnote-23\" target=\"_self\">23</a></p><p>His methods are comparative; extant myths are so similar in Japan, Greece, and Mexico that they must share an ancient root. To see what he meant, let’s look back to prehistoric examples with an eye toward entheogenic use.</p><p>In Texas circa 500 AD, a man ate a rattlesnake, fangs, scales, and all. We know this because archeologists found and analyzed his poop (er… <em>coprolite</em>). This is interpreted as being part of a ritual because people usually don’t eat fangs or the rattle. Further, the creation stories in this region are teeming with horned or feathered serpents, a tradition that seems to go back thousands of years based on cave art. For example, see the <a href=\"https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/baja/serpent_cave/index.php\">Serpent Cave in Baja California</a>, dated 7.5kya.

Employing venom as an entheogen could cause these metaphors to be naturally reinvented. I contend the hallucinogenic practice that produced them spread with the original snake cult. It’s also worth noting that such a practice could evolve as less dangerous entheogens were found (particularly in the Americas), and the snake connection would only live on in legend. Peyote was used in rituals <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874105002990?casa_token=x0xrrPHIp4oAAAAA:pd1IWXPlos-12buqAEapc0Q7HjCRpA5liLCyRKPhMkebLquxqgylNCg-Pyqd_xBAdxLUpO4Gbg\">as early as 6 kya</a>, for example.</p><p>The paper that analyzed Texas coprolite was published in 2019 and claimed to be the first to discuss archeological evidence of the ritual digestion of a venomous snake. The next year, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66301-5\">paper published in Nature</a> analyzed a collection of snake bones found in an Israeli cave, deposited 15-12 kya. They do not discuss ritual but do observe that the venomous snakes were more likely to be digested than the non-venomous ones.</p><p>These Near Eastern snake-eaters are Natufians <a href=\"https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2017/05/ancient-egyptians-less-sub-saharan-than.html\">who genetically cluster with the much later Egyptians</a>. They are a culturally important group that presaged the coming Agricultural Revolution with their own revolutions. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_spectrum_revolution\">Broad spectrum revolution</a> (exploiting a wider range of food sources, including smaller animals such as fish, snakes, and rabbits) is hypothesized to have allowed the Natufians to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26595354\">adopt a sedentary lifestyle</a>. Staying put, in turn, led to agriculture. </p><p>Archeologist Jacques Cauvin argues that the beginnings of agriculture were not so mundane; they marked a change in human consciousness. The Natufians and others in the Near East experienced a “revolution of symbols,” a conceptual shift that allowed humans to imagine gods—supernatural beings resembling humans—that existed in a universe beyond the physical world. It’s worth emphasizing that for Cauvin, this is a cultural, not neurological, change.</p><p>His ideas have been given new life by the excavation of Göbekli Tepe, the world’s oldest temple. Klaus Schmidt oversaw the excavation for two decades and said that Cauvin’s central point was proven right: religion preceded agriculture.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-25\" href=\"#footnote-25\" target=\"_self\">25</a> The EToC reading is that recursion was becoming more natural, and along with it, duality and thinking about the future. Agriculture was the result, in part due to the Snake Cult.</p><p>It’s difficult to show the entheogenic use of venom 11 kya. However, a full <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237785162_Animals_in_the_Symbolic_World_of_Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_Gobekli_Tepe_South-eastern_Turkey_A_Preliminary_Assessment\">28.4% of the carved animals at Gobekli Tepe are snakes</a>, double the second most commonly depicted animal, the fox, at 14.8%. And this counts groups of animals as just one occurrence. Snakes, which are often carved in bunches, account for half of all identifiable animals if you break them up as individuals.</p><p>Göbekli Tepe is sometimes treated as coming out of nowhere. But from the view of the Snake Cult, it fits nicely into a well-accepted phylogeny of snakes used in rituals of death and rebirth. Snake figurines are a <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/41335894/SNAKES_IN_THE_PLAIN_Contextualizing_prehistoric_Near_Eastern_snake_symbolism_and_early_human_behaviour\">dominant theme</a> in many archeological sites near Göbekli Tepe, including Körtik Tepe, which precedes it by a thousand years. Further north, in a burial in Siberia, a boy was buried 24 kya at the height of the Ice Age. <a href=\"https://donsmaps.com/malta.html\">In his burial</a>, we find mammoth ivory carved with snakes that look like cobras. Cobras (or any snakes?) did not live in such a frigid climate. These were likely foreign gods that had traveled with these people. Clearly, they had staying symbolic power. (Similarly, <a href=\"https://donsmaps.com/malta.html\">this culture carved many Venus Statues</a>, which were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurine\">common in Europe</a> at the same time.)</p><p>Back in Venus’s motherland, they performed <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vQHXuIiu6pY?t=343\">headless snake rituals</a> as far back as 17 kya. Two decapitated snake skeletons were found in a Pyrenees cave decorated with headless bison. Imagine what it would be like to enter that cave by firelight after days of fasting. It would be abundantly clear to an initiate they were about to lose their head. The link above is to an Indo-European specialist who describes it as evidence of Europe’s first dragon ritual.</p><p>Finally, though figures are what gets attention, most cave art consists of abstract symbols. There are <a href=\"https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/geometric_signs/index.php\">20 or so symbols</a> that are found in cave art the world over. These are thought to be a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/could-these-cave-markings-be-the-earliest-form-of-writing-180981403/\">form of proto-writing</a> whose meaning was consistent across time. Of those, serpents and birds are the only two animal forms, with the serpentiform first appearing 30 kya. The snakes at Göbekli Tepe don’t just pop out of nowhere. They are part of a deep and widely shared cultural heritage remembered from Egypt to China to Mexico.</p><p>Many scholars, such as Buckland, Witzel, <a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/contra-dhuy-on-snake-myths\">d’Huy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQHXuIiu6pY&t=343s\">White</a>, treat serpent myths in the Americas and Eurasia as stemming from the same root deep in the past. Separately, others argue snake venom was used as an entheogen in Greece and India (and tentatively America). I suggest combining these ideas: snakes are associated with creation because their venom served as the entheogen in the original Eurasian religion, which spread to the Americas. Establishing venom as the primordial Soma is a worthy goal. But for this to be a human story, the whole world must be gathered into the Cult.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>This is about half of Andrew’s essay; the second half of “<a href=\"https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/eve-theory-of-consciousness-v3\">The Eve Theory of Consciousness</a>” can be found on his blog.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

As such, the Big Five were identified by analyzing the distribution of personality adjectives. In their most successful model of personality, psychologists gave up theorizing and deferred to the masses. The collaborative project of language can find the shape of seemingly incomprehensible abstractions, including about what sets humans apart.

XAFR, along with Neanderthals and Denisovans, are modeled to have separated from humans 600+ kya. At 71 kya, the Out of Africa group breaks away from ancient Africans. At 58 kya, a Back to Africa group separates from Eurasians and wipes out the ancient Africans, as well as XAFR. <em>“Our method predicted the admixture proportion from back to Africa to be as high as 91% (CI 90.28–91.57), suggesting a massive replacement of the ancient African population.”</em></p><p>This kind of makes sense. If the Out of Africa group had some advantage that let them absorb/conquer the Neanderthals and Denisovans, this would also apply in Africa. To be clear, this is also another model and should not be taken as ground truth. And again, the object of this essay is to separate our memetic and genetic origins; we could have become human after the earliest splits. But it’s useful in thinking about humanity’s most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and how that informs these debates. This model has the MRCA at no more than 58kya. In reality, it is more recent as the complete human tree resembles more of a bramble in the last 50,000 years. It’s not as if Europe and Asia were genetically separated for 33,000 years; as the model shows, there was plenty of mixing across continents.</p><p>Turning to other evidence for sapience going back 200,000 years. Early dates often rely on maternal and paternal MRCA: Y chromosomal Adam, or mitochondrial Eve. This gives dates of ~200,000. But consider the scenario where XAFR, Neanderthal, or Denisovans had surviving Y chromosomal or mitochondrial DNA lineages in modern humans. Would that suddenly make our species 600,000 years old? Would it make universals like marriage, art, and storytelling that old?</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-9\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-9\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">9</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6491325-the-rise-of-homo-sapiens\">The Rise of Homo sapiens: The Evolution of Modern Thinking</a></em>, page 238</p><p>Carl Ruck gives the same date in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Entheogens-Myth-Human-Consciousness-Carl/dp/1579511414\">Entheogens, Myth, and Human Consciousness</a>: <em>“Humans have left a record of cognitive experiences dating back to the first emergence of Homo sapiens in the late Paleolithic Age roughly 32,000 years ago.” </em>He even muses that initiation rites performed worldwide hearken back to the cave temples where we find the earliest art, something we will return to:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Among indigenous people today who still enact cave rites, women and men have separate caves.

As we have discussed, before the rapid, continent-wide cultural changes of the middle to late Holocene period, the tempo of cultural change in Australia was slow and sporadic and the distribution of symbolic activity was patchy in time and space. We believe there are broad similarities between patterning in the Pleistocene and Holocene Australian archaeological record and patterning in the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic archaeological records of Africa and Europe, similarities that cannot be comfortably ignored. Applying the archaeological signature of modern human behaviour advocated by ‘short-range’ proponents to Pleistocene Australia indicates that the ancestors of Aboriginal people were not behaviourally modern until relatively recently, perhaps only the last 7000 years.

He writes: <em>“The Upper Paleolithic marked nearly 30,000 years of almost constant change, culminating in a level of modernity equivalent to that of many present-day indigenous peoples.”</em> Given his emphasis on evolution taking time, and the process starting at 40 kya, I interpret that to mean modern levels of recursion were obtained 30,000 years later, which is 10 kya.

The value of ungrading, particularly considering major assignments like exams, is supported mostly by theoretical scholarship and qualitative studies. This article describes a controlled experiment testing whether it is detrimental to give students an unconditional 100% on a test, in terms of future performance on that same test. These experiments took place over three semesters, at two universities, in two different undergraduate classes (neuroscience and psychology), including a total of 409 students. Results were mixed: during the first two semesters, when comparing students who were originally graded to those who were not, there was no difference in performance on that same test 2-3 months later. However, in the final semester, students who were traditionally graded scored 4-5% better on the same test one week to six weeks later. Consequently, this data supports the broader testing of diverse grading practices, including transcripts that do not contain grades.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Theoretically, an instructor's recommendation to schools and employers, in the form of transcript grades, could act as carrots and sticks to promote greater learning. One way to evaluate this prospect is to randomly assign some students to complete individual assignments for a grade, while merely encouraging other students to complete the assignment without any tangible consequences.</p><p>When homework is voluntary, unsurprisingly, college students rarely do it, yet those who are required to do homework exhibit either little (2-4%) or no performance increases on later exams (Trost & Salehi-Isfahani, 2012; Pozo et al., 2006; Grodner & Rupp, 2013). Similarly mixed results have been observed when grading quizzes. For example, in a psychology class, a study found that during units in which quizzes were graded, students were more likely to earn A’s on a unit exam (Dalfen et al., 2018). However, another study showed that students who were graded on quizzes actually performed 4% worse on a final exam, compared to those that were only given practice quizzes (Wickline & Spektor, 2011). Similarly, another study found that students who were assigned graded quizzes scored worse on the final exam (75%) compared to those who were given no quizzes (78%) and those who were given practice quizzes (82%) (Khanna, 2015).</p><p>One reason why grades may not motivate long-term learning is that they incentivize cramming (Fergus, 2022; Rodriguez et al., 2018) and cheating (Vandehey et al., 2007). In contrast, spreading study sessions over time enhances long-term learning, though it may reduce the efficiency of test performance relative to the time spent studying. Similarly, activities like creatively exploring material beyond the course, comparing new concepts with idiosyncratic prior knowledge, or critiquing a professor’s ideas are rarely efficient for exam preparation. It takes less time to accept that \"the amygdala is the fear center of the brain\" than to ponder what \"is the\" means or how amygdala research impacts clinical care for anxiety disorders. Without the pressure of grades, students will have more time to think creatively, critically, and personally, in a way that could foster lasting understanding.</p><p>Several studies, conducted both in K-12 and college classrooms, have demonstrated that providing comments on assignments or quizzes, without grades, increases student interest in class material (Butler & Nisan, 1986; Butler, 1988), increases the chance that students will voluntarily choose a challenging assignment in the future (Harter, 1978; Deci, 1999), and may even increase performance on later tests (Wickline & Spektor, 2011; Khanna, 2015). In universities that rely on narrative transcripts (which do contain instructor evaluations but do not contain letter grades), students are more likely to feel like they are using their time valuably (Chamberlin et al., 2023), which could perhaps lead to greater retention rates.</p><p>The study attempts to build upon prior studies in two ways. First, this study provides enhanced methodological rigor, for example, by assigning students to conditions based on their last name (as opposed to prior quasi-experimental studies that have assigned students to conditions based on course section, as in Wickline and Skeptor [2011] and Khanna [2015]), and testing performance on the same exam (as opposed to comparing across different exams, as in Dalfen et al. [2018]). Moreover, the experiments presented here appear to be the first to test a high-stakes assessment such as an exam (20-25% of one’s course grade).</p><h2><strong>Methods</strong></h2><h4><strong>Procedure and Primary Outcome Measures</strong></h4><p>Each semester included either one or two midterm exams (see Table 1 for a description of each study). For each exam, some students were traditionally graded, and others were given 100% based solely on completion (yet all students saw their actual grades until the end of the semester as a way to provide feedback). </p><p>The primary outcome was the percentage score on a surprise re-test of each midterm exam, administered remotely (on Canvas) during a final exam timeslot, 1 week to 3 months after completing the original midterm exam. This measure was selected as an attempt to simulate students' retention after completing a class (and perhaps therefore, preparedness for further classes or jobs). To maintain the deception, all students were told they would be tested on content that was not explicitly included in the midterm exams, albeit the exact instructions differed by semester (see Table 1).</p><p>In semester 1, group assignment was based on course section. In semesters 2 and 3, group assignment was based on last name (rather than true randomization, in an attempt to minimize this experiment’s intrusiveness into the student's learning experience). Students could not be blinded to their experimental condition, and I did not blind myself during the analysis regarding which student was in which group.</p><p>All midterm exams (including the introductory psychology course) were closed-note, multiple choice, administered in class on the learning management system Canvas, and all covered similar topics in biological psychology and were drawn from the same textbook (forthcoming with Cambridge University Press). Cronbach’s alpha was calculated from semester 3’s exams, including .85 and .84 for the exam 1 and exam 2 midterm, and .76 and .57 for the exam 1 and 2 retention test. Semester 3’s exam questions are included on OSF, the same questions were used in prior experiments with slight modifications to wording and answer choices. </p><h4><strong>Pre-semester Attitudes Toward Grades Survey</strong></h4><p>Surveys were administered at the beginning of each semester as a means for gauging prior knowledge, interests, and soliciting preliminary attitudes toward grades. A summary of relevant questions is presented in Figure 2 and the full surveys are included on OSF. These data were collected from students who took part in the experiments cited in the main text, as well as 29 additional students from the professor’s other introductory psychology class at Emory University who did not take part in the ungrading experiments.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png\" width=\"597\" height=\"385.16129032258067\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":300,\"width\":465,\"resizeWidth\":597,\"bytes\":43251,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f45dc5-e284-4563-a1df-f186e098f2da_465x300.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Table 1: </strong><em><strong>Study Design by Semester </strong>-<strong> </strong></em>Sample size indicates the number of students who met the inclusion criteria for the retention test. Detailed statistics on quiz-condition in semester 3 are not reported due to non-significant results and for the sake of brevity, but all data is available on OSF.</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>Midterm Exam Survey and Planned Data Collection</strong></h4><p>During semester 3, surveys were administered at the end of each exam asking students about how they studied, how much they studied, and whether they attributed any mental health challenges to the exam (defined broadly to include stress, depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions). Although this data was collected, it was only available for a limited analysis due to unforeseen limitations in the course management software (in summary, in the course management platform Canvas, the “New Quizzes” feature only provides summary statistics for each question, it does not allow responses to be broken down by individual student - if this feature becomes available, this data may be uploaded to the OSF portal). Table 3 presents this data in full, in the order that the survey was administered at the end of the exam, without breaking this data down by group.</p><p>Additional planned data collection, initially outlined in the OSF pre-registration, did not occur. The collection of these data was omitted due to concerns over the potential undue time burden on participants and my belief that the data described in the last paragraph would more effectively capture student experiences.</p><h4><strong>Participant Population</strong></h4><p>There were no a priori criteria for determining sample size. Using an 80% power threshold, semester 1’s study was able to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.62, or 6.8% on the exam. In semester 2, the exam 1 and 2 retention tests could detect a standardized mean difference of 0.61 (8.4%) and 0.60 (5.6%). In semester 3, the exam 1 and 2 retention tests could detect a standardized mean difference of 0.22 (3%) and 0.24 (4.2%).</p><p>The sample size was limited by the number of participants in each class, and the total number of experiments (3) was determined based on the goal of improving internal validity (semi-random assignment in experiments 2 and 3), conceptually replicating original findings (experiment 2 and 3), and generalizing to a different class and university (experiment 3). </p><p>In all semesters, students were asked to voluntarily disclose race, ethnicity, and gender (Table 3). At Emory University, due to inconsistencies in the survey format, this data can not reliably be attributed to specific students who were in this experiment (as distinguished from other classes), and therefore data are presented in aggregate.</p><h4><strong>Rationale for Excluding Subjects</strong></h4><p>I attempted to exclude all test scores in which I had reason to believe that scores did not reflect a student's knowledge, such as when I suspected that a student cheated or did not try on the exam. These rationales evolved each semester and became formalized by the final experiment. In all semesters, there were no procedures for imputing missing data for students who did not complete their retention test (final exam). More detail in pre-registrations for semester’s two and three at OSF (<a href=\"https://osf.io/6d4c7/\">https://osf.io/6d4c7/</a>).</p><p>Note that a very large number of students were excluded (6 of 47, 5 of 47, and 141 of 455 in semesters 1-3 respectively) largely explained by the absence of a concrete incentive for effort during completion-graded exams (note that during in-person mid-term exams at Indiana University, several students brazenly walked out after completing the exam in only a few minutes). However, when conducting the same analyses without excluding subjects, only one test changed from significant to non-significant (semester 3, unit 1 retention test, as will be further described in the results section).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"403.52542372881356\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":279,\"width\":354,\"resizeWidth\":512,\"bytes\":22273,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbc4d6ad-607f-4f17-b083-37c5d11641ca_354x279.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Table 3: </strong><em><strong>Student Demographics </strong>-<strong> </strong></em>Data from Indiana University include the students who participated in the ungrading experiments as well as 29 additional students in the professor’s other introductory psychology course.

In semester 1, there were no significant differences between traditionally-graded and completion-graded students at all, either for the midterm exam (<em>z</em> = 1.87, <em>p</em> = 0.06, 95% CI: -2.3% to 17.7%) or the retention exam (<em>z</em> = 0.66, <em>p</em> = 0.51, 95% CI: -7.6% to 5.7%) administered 67 days later (Figure 1).</p><p>In semester 2, two midterm exams were included, and students crossed over (such that they were traditionally-graded on one exam and completion-graded on the other), and at the end of the semester, both tests were re-administered. Traditionally graded students scored 15.8% higher on the unit 1 mid-term (<em>z</em> = 3.40, <em>p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 7.1% to 24.6%) and 14.4% higher unit 2 mid-term (<em>z</em> = 4.00, <em>p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 8.2% to 20.7%). However, there were no significant differences on the unit 1 retention test (<em>z</em> = 0.99, <em>p</em> = 0.32, 95% CI: -4.5 to 13.2%) nor on the unit 2 retention test (<em>z </em>= 1.07, <em>p</em> = 0.28, 95% CI: -3.3% to 8.5%), administered 86 and 65 days later.</p><p>Semester 3’s experiments in Fall 2023 were conducted at Indiana University in an introductory psychology class (emphasizing research methods, neuroscience, and cognition), which commonly fulfills a general education requirement. This semester, two midterm exams were included alongside two sets of quizzes. Again, students crossed over, such that everyone was traditionally-graded on one exam and one quiz set. These two independent variables were fully crossed, such that some students were traditionally graded on both quizzes and exams in the same unit, while others were mixed. Again, at the end of the semester, both tests were re-administered. This paper’s main text does not break down data by quiz-condition because no significant differences were observed (the full dataset is available on OSF).</p><p>During semester 3, on the unit 1 midterm, traditionally-graded students scored 12.5% higher (<em>z</em> = 8.6, <em>p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 11.0% to 13.9%), and for the unit 2 midterm, traditionally graded students scored 11.0% higher (<em>z</em> = 6.4,<em> p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 9.5% to 12.4%). In unit 1's retention test, traditionally graded students scored 4.8% higher (<em>z</em> = 3.1,<em> p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.8% to 6.9%), while in unit 2’s retention test, traditionally graded students scored 3.8% higher (<em>z</em> = 3.0, <em>p</em> < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.1% to 5.6%). This semester’s retention exams were administered 48 and 9 days after the midterm. As noted in the methods, the only instance in which excluding subjects affected decisions of statistical significance was during semester 3’s unit 1 retention exam: When all students were included, there no longer was any significant difference observed in exam scores between groups.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1360\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1360,\"width\":1456,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f83af66-d41f-491a-be3f-b569ec4ecf41_1600x1494.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><strong>Figure 1: </strong><em><strong>The Effect of Grading Scheme on Exam Performance</strong></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Depending on the semester, grading an exam has mixed effects on performance on a retention test administered 9-86 days after a midterm. <em>Top left and bottom two rows</em>: In each graph, group means & standard errors reflect the statistics cited in the main text which excluded participants who were suspected of cheating or not trying. However, for semester 3, all individual data points are included in the background image for clarity since a large number of students were excluded. <em>Top right:</em> Mean difference in exam scores between traditionally-graded and completion-graded students, as a function of retention-test interval time, including 95% confidence interval. * indicates p < 0.05.</p><h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2><p>Using null-hypothesis significance testing with a conventional threshold of p < 0.05, this study observed mixed results. The final semester’s experiments supported the hypothesis that grading exams improves long-term learning (by 4% to 5%), or consequently, that midterm grades reflect some durable knowledge. However, the other two semesters' data do not support the hypothesis.</p><p>One explanation for the discrepant results is the sample size. Both significant findings were observed at Indiana University in which data were collected from 278-324 students, in contrast to the experiments at Emory, which included 41-44 students each. Supporting this hypothesis, in two of three experiments at Emory, traditionally-graded students scored 2% to 4% higher on average. This observation illustrates that although studies differed in terms of reaching a conventional threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, all studies observed similar average differences in retention-grades. If it is true and generalizable that grading exams leads to up to 5% greater retention, it could represent a benchmark for comparison: people who advocate for ungrading would have to justify that the benefits of ungrading exceed this number. </p><p>A second possibility is that the effect of grading depends on the class and student populations. The first two experiments were conducted at a selective private college, in a 200-level elective neuroscience course. Many of these students were contemplating scientific careers, and therefore, perhaps were motivated to study regardless of grades. Moreover, these classes included 25 students, allowing me to frequently interact with individual students and to assign student presentations at the end of the semester. If the experiments at Emory are generalizable to other elective courses, other small classes, or other selective universities, this result could undermine a major rationale underlying a foundational educational practice.</p><p>One final explanation is the timing of the retention exam. Due to idiosyncrasies in each class (based on distinct curricular requirements), the retention interval in both Indiana University experiments was shorter than all studies conducted at Emory (9-48 days vs 65-86 days)<em>.</em> Supporting this hypothesis, when comparing the rate of performance decay from midterm to the retention test, all five studies observed that student performance on traditionally-graded exams decayed faster than performance on completion-graded exams (which often did not decay at all). Again, if true, this result could undermine a major rationale underlying a foundational educational practice.</p><p>These findings align with a meta-analysis showing that undergraduate grades account for only 4-6% of the variance in supervisor-rated job performance across various industries (Roth et al., 1996). If students who perform well on midterm exams do not sustain this performance even before the semester ends, then in some respects, they may be no better prepared for future education or careers. Grades today are compromised by factors such as cheating (Vandehey et al., 2007), cramming (Fergus, 2022; Rodriguez et al., 2018), knowledge of one’s instructor biases (Becker et al., 1968), and test-taking skills (Towns & Robinson, 1993; Rogers & Harley, 1999). This suggests that if colleges were to limit third-party access to student performance metrics, they might not be withholding highly valuable information.</p><p>The simplest alternative to a traditional grading system is one in which grades are kept confidential between a student and their instructor. The value of confidentiality in grading may be seen by analogy to other professions: doctors don’t share health information (like a patient’s drug use) because patients would stop sharing medically-relevant behaviors, lawyers don’t share a defendant's entire informal testimony because it could harm the defendant's case, financial advisors don’t share their client's assets because it could lead to exploitation. Perhaps something similar would be valuable in education. If student performance was confidential, at least some students would engage with the material more critically, creatively, and personally. Moreover, perhaps instructors could more accurately assess durable learning, as assignment scores may be less tainted by cheating and memorization. Moreover, perhaps this would force employers and graduate schools to invest more time or money into developing procedures for hiring and admissions that better predict future performance, such as work samples, personality tests, or integrity tests (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998).</p><p>Overall, the number of stakeholders to grades is vast and diverse: it is worthwhile to consider the value of grades both in the classroom as well as to third parties. It is likely that a professor’s evaluation of their student’s class performance is useful for some purposes but not for others, and for this reason alone, it may be useful for universities to continue providing grades to third parties. However, the value provided to third parties should be weighed against the costs and benefits of this practice to students in terms of learning and well-being.</p><h2><strong>Gardener Comments</strong></h2><p><strong>Greg Baker: </strong><br>While it's possible to nitpick the methodology or the analysis, it's valuable research overall. It is a bold attempt at answering a question that few are brave enough even to ask.</p><p><strong>Richard Sprague:</strong><br>Excellent example of SoS paper: yes, it's okay that the data collection wasn't completely consistent across the universities. The point is to get the data out there, note the problems, and let others potentially learn something.</p><p><strong>Anonymous 1:</strong><br>The problem with the study is the lack of meta-analysis of the overall results. With small sample sizes, varying levels of 'significance' (p values won't be consistently below 5%) are expected solely due to sampling error (because of low power), and this doesn't mean the results are \"mixed\". That's the mistake that Schmidt and Hunter wrote about for many decades. To avoid this error is easy, convert the results to Cohen's d for each study, and do a meta-analysis. It's easy with R. Looking at your figure 1, it's easy to see that in 9 or 10 out of the 10 comparisons, traditional grading did better. Thus, we can be pretty confident the traditional grading effect is positive, not zero or negative. Note: since you have multiple outcomes for some samples, you probably have to use multi-level meta-analysis to be entirely rigorous, though I doubt this would affect things much. Read this: <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/\">Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R</a></p><p>I don't see where it is written what software the analyses were done with. Ideally, you will add the output from this to the OSF. I looked but didn't see any code output (R markdown, Python notebook, SPSS output, or something else).</p><p><strong>DK (PhD in psychology):</strong><br>There are several problems I see in this research. Most notably, too few universities and participants were used to get reliable insights into the impact of exam scores on knowledge retention. Nevertheless, there are some positive aspects, such as pre-registration, and I am generally against the \"file-drawer problem\", given that many studies that are conducted are eventually not published, so I would recommend publishing this and making sure it can inform other similar studies. </p><p><strong>Malmesbury:</strong><br>I really liked this article and the general approach of doing an experiment to check whether the foundational things we take for granted actually work as intended. The author uses a cross-over design where university students are promised an unconditional 100% grade, and measures the effect on exam grades, as well as a later retention test.</p><p>The paper is well-written; it explains clearly how the experimental process was altered a bit over time. A few points weren't very clear to me:</p><ul><li><p>For semester 3, one exclusion criterion is an overall score <50%. However, the plots show a lot of points below that grade. Is it because it's the overall score over multiple exams, and these points are compensated by a better grade on another exam? In the latter case, this could cause problems with Berkson's paradox.</p></li><li><p>Given a large number of students have grades near or below the \"no effort\" exclusion criterion, I'm worried that it could distort the results (for example, an increase in variance could lead to an artifactual increase in mean).</p></li><li><p>I haven't checked the numbers myself, but according to the author, the results wouldn't be different without the ad-hoc exclusion criteria. In that case, I think it'd be fine to just show the data without excluding students. Then of course it means deviating from pre-registration for the later studies, but as long as things are straightforward and transparent I don't think it's a problem. Ideally, it should be easy to check whether the exclusion of students is creating statistical artifacts, and if that's the case that's a good enough justification to deviate from pre-registration.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Heidi Zamzow (PhD student, Psychological and Behavioural Science):</strong><br>This study had some interesting ideas which would be useful to develop further. However, I did not see how the research question, methods, findings, and particularly the conclusion link up. </p><p>I was unclear on whether the issue was more about the practice of assigning grades or rather the practice of sharing grades with third parties, which to me seem quite different. </p><p>The evidence cited didn't always seem to support the argument being made. For instance, showing that providing comments on assignments can have beneficial outcomes does not imply that grades are useless or harmful, but rather that comments are helpful.</p><p>I find the author's claim that the study 'provides enhanced methodological rigour' a bit dubious. I found the justification for the exclusion criteria to be weak. If the results are to be useful for real-world application, a more transparent approach would be to report the outcome for the whole sample and then perhaps a subgroup with these exclusions. </p><p>I did not see any mention of how the data from the surveys administered at the beginning of the semester were used; it seems it would be necessary to control for prior knowledge, at a minimum, and report findings in the text with and without covariates. Determining the influence of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race also would be important, but unfortunately due to the design of the study these could not be tested as covariates.</p><p>Though the author did note the differences between the two universities/classes could account for the 'mixed findings', I would say they are TOO different to be compared in the same study at all. </p><p>The author touches on some relevant theory (i.e., self-determination theory) but the article could be improved by developing this further to show how theory informed the hypothesis being tested (which actually wasn't clearly stated).</p><p>I was also a bit unclear on the ethics, as it seemed the experiment had the potential to impact students' grades at the end of the year?</p><p>On a broader note, to address the issue of graduate schools and employers using GPA to predict future performance, the problem seems to be more one of changing the criteria for acceptance/entrance rather than changing the grading system per se. This is already being done, for instance, in more 'elite' universities in the US, where GPA counts for only a small portion of the admittance criteria -- just one factor amongst many.</p><p><strong>Phil Filippak:</strong><br>The main thing I want to add is that I think preserving grading in universities is common sense, but it's good to see at least some statistics supporting that notion. I suspect that the exams might have gotten too easy in general, since the distributions of grades are too close to the top for most students (but maybe I'm mistaken, and it's the students who have gotten really smart in the last few decades).</p><p><strong>Billy Bob:<br></strong>I found this article to be interesting and engaging. I believe that the article sets up an interesting and relevant premise and that the experiments do generally address the primary question. Given the circumstances under which these data were collected, I think that the experimental design and data collection processes are adequate. My primary issue is in data analysis, particularly Fig. 1 Semester 3. It seems to me that the statistical tests for the Retention data of both Units 1 and 2 are primarily reporting on the size of the datasets as opposed to actual differences between the means or the distributions. With larger sample sizes, common statistical tests that are meant to test the equivalence of means between two datasets tend to fail because the exact means are not equal. If the author has the time and bandwidth, I would recommend that they consider performing permutation tests for all of the Semester 3 data. Not only can these tests potentially deal with this issue of large sample size, but these tests can also be used to make stronger statements between datasets, such as that two distributions are equivalent. </p><p><strong>Joe R:<br></strong>This looks like a reasonable question to ask and a decent, if possibly flawed, attempt to answer it. I felt confused by the exclusion criteria. In particular, Semester 3 excluded a lot of students, and the explanation listed three criteria, said that only one was excluded, but also said that only one was used. What of the third? Which contributed the most to exclusions? I worry that excluding that many students (particularly ones who \"completed assignments toward the end of the semester that essentially constituted studying for the exam\") might confound the results. I lacked the time for a deep dive into the data; these and other potential issues should probably be checked more thoroughly before publishing. But I didn't notice any glaring flaws in the writeup itself. I think studying retention specifically, rather than initial test performance, was a good decision and produced interesting results. </p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Appelbaum, M., Cooper, H., Kline, R.

The FDA approved a medication called Cobenfy, a combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride, for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p><p>What’s exciting is that this one has a novel mechanism of action. <em>There is no direct antidopaminergic activity</em>. Xanomeline is an agonist at the M1 and M4 receptors. It’s the first novel therapeutic for schizophrenia in something like 70 years!</p><p>Er, probably? People who really know their psychopharm might remember that clozapine is <em>also</em> an agonist at M4 and its major metabolite norclozapine is an agonist at M1!<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> I’ve suspected that this might be more than just trivia, but this is still just a pet theory.</p><p>I’m going to talk about the details a little bit, but if you want a really — and I mean <em>really</em> — thorough overview of the muscarinic receptors as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia I would recommend you read this <a href=\"http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.21101083\">overview in the Sept ‘22 edition of the AJP from Paul et al.</a>.</p><p><em>If you just want to skip to my breakdown of the study below, here’s a tl;dr: Xanomeline is an agonist at M1 and M4. Trospium is a antimuscarinic that does not cross the blood brain barrier, and is included to block xanomeline’s action outside of the CNS.</em></p><h4><strong>A Little Pharmacology</strong></h4><p>Muscarinic agonists are not a common therapeutic class in medicine. There’s bethanechol, a peripherally acting agonist to prevent post-op ileus and urinary retention, a couple of compounds used as topicals to manage glaucoma, and methacholine, which we use to induce asthma attacks in people… so we can diagnose them with asthma. Medicine, what a field!</p><p>You may have noticed that I didn’t specify <em>which</em> muscarinic receptors these drugs activate, that’s because it’s all of them. M1 through M5.</p><p>See, even though we’ve characterized five different muscarinic receptors, their binding sites are so similar that it is really, really hard to design a molecule that only binds to a subset of them. For whatever reason, it’s been much easier to find selective antagonists (or inverse agonists). I’m guessing that this is because antagonists just have to block the binding site, not bind in <em>just</em> the right way to activate the receptor; it’s very easy to imagine how you might block a keyhole, but much harder to design an effective lockpick.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>So, xanomeline being a <em>selective</em> muscarinic agonist at M1 and M4 makes it even more unique. Turns out that xanomeline — just like every other muscarinic agonist — actually has high affinity for all of the muscarinic receptors, but is not equally <em>potent </em>at each.</p><p>First, xanomeline binds allosterically<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> at both <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16675658/\">M1 </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41199-5\">M4</a> in addition to binding the orthosteric (typical) binding site for these receptors. It apparently <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16675658/\">sticks quite tightly</a> to this allosteric site and — at least for M1 — seems to directly and persistently activate the receptor when bound.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> It also appears to bind quite tightly to the M5 receptor, thought it instead acts an antagonist.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>Xanomeline also exhibits functional selectivity<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, which means that its binding results in activation of alternative G-protein pathways relative to the endogenous ligand. For example, a receptor that was formerly G(q) dominant might become more G(i) dominant when bound by a functionally selective ligand.</p><h4><strong>A Little History</strong></h4><p>Xanomeline was originally developed in the 1990’s as part of an effort to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease. It was one of many muscarinic agonists designed to restore the cholinergic tone caused by a loss of neurons that project to the hippocampus. Most were intolerable due to their side-effects and didn’t have much of an effect on cognition. Xanomeline also had side-effects, only did an OK job at improving cognition, <em>but</em> it significantly reduced — and even appeared to prevent — behavioral and psychotic symptoms in demented patients.</p><p>You can see where this is going.</p><p>In 2008 <em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18593778/\">Shekhar et al.</a> </em>published a small (N = 20) 4-week, randomized, placebo controlled trial of xanomeline (no trospium yet!) in moderately ill schizophrenics. Target dose was 225mg qDay.</p><p>This study showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in total PANSS scores (μ improvement = 24 points), though just barely (p = 0.039). They also showed statistically significant improvements on a few cognitive tasks: digit span, story recall, list learning, and delayed memory. However, these were only 4 of 18 separate cognitive measures and the p-values were not particularly robust; the only exception was for story recall (p < 0.01). The rest were just a bit under 0.05.</p><p>As you might expect with a muscarinic agonist, there were a lot of gastrointestinal side-effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on. That said, the authors report that these were generally mild and no participant withdrew from the study for these reasons.</p><p>In 2016 <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10102054/\">Breier et al.</a> </em>did the first Phase I trial in which xanomeline 75mg TID was co-administered with trospium 20mg BID and found that it reduced the rate of xanomeline-induced side-effects by about 50%. A second Phase I trial <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455874/\">published in 2019</a> simplified the dosing regimen with BID trospium, and found similar success. KarXT was off to the races.</p><h2>Ok Ok Let’s Talk About The Paper</h2><p><em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063924/\">Efficacy and Safety of Xanomeline-Trospium Chloride in Schizophrenia A Randomized Clinical Trial</a></em> by Kaul et al. published the August edition of JAMA Psychiatry.</p><p>From here on out, I’m just going to refer to the drug as “xanomeline” instead of xanomeline/trospium all the time. Combination drugs are the one time I’m really tempted to use brand names, but I refuse to let Big Pharma win. Also KarXT is a way cooler name than Cobenfy.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial carried out in the US and Ukraine<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> between April 1, 2021 to December 7, 2022.</p><h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4><p><em>This is a summary, you can find full inclusion/exclusion criteria <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04738123\">here</a></em></p><ul><li><p>Between the ages of 18-65</p></li><li><p>Primary diagnosis of schizophrenia with an acute exacerbation within the last 2 months.</p><ul><li><p>If they were already inpatient, hospitalization must have started within 2 weeks of enrollment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>PANSS score between 80-120 (inclusive), and a score <em><strong>≥</strong></em>4<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a><sup> </sup>on at least two of 4 selected positive symptom items<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p></li><li><p>CGI-S score needed to be at least a 4 (i.e. moderately ill)</p></li><li><p>Off all psychoactive medications for at least 1 week or 5 half-lives, whichever was longer</p><ul><li><p>For patients previously on a LAI, most recent injection must have been >12 weeks prior</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Frankly, the washout period is a bit short for my liking. Drug elimination half-life has a lot of individual variation. Take olanzapine for example; the range between the 5th and 95th percentile is 21-54 hours. That means that the 5th percentile only requires 4.4 days for complete elimination, while the 95th percentile requires 11.3 days. That’s not a small difference!</p><p>It’s not even clear from the study what authority they’re using to define a drug’s half-life, or if they’re considering active metabolites. Cariprazine has an active metabolite whose half-life is ~2 weeks; a full washout would take 2.5 months!</p><p>I don’t think this seriously undermines the results or anything, but it does make me wonder if the results would be substantially different in the treatment naive.</p><h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4><p>Individuals were excluded if:</p><ul><li><p>They had a primary psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia within 12 months prior to screening.</p></li><li><p>New diagnosis of schizophrenia OR no history of treatment for schizophrenia</p></li><li><p>History of treatment resistance to antipsychotic medication</p></li><li><p>Their PANSS score improved by more than 20% between screening and baseline (i.e. start of study)</p></li></ul><p>Seems fine? It is worth nothing that the second bullet in the list means that this study is semi-enriched for previous responders to antipsychotics. I say “semi-enriched” because the criteria allows individuals who have tried and failed a single antipsychotic to thread the needle and be eligible for inclusion.</p><p>Along these lines, it’s also worth noting that patients did not have to be on treatment at the time of enrollment, and there was no timeframe in which they needed to have received treatment prior to enrollment. I’d want to know whether the randomization produced groups with statistically similar numbers of patients who had a remote history of treatment in both groups.</p><h4>Interventions</h4><p>Dosing started with xanomeline/trospium 50/20mg BID for 2 days, then 100/20mg BID for days 3-7. Starting on day 8, patients were increased to 125/30mg BID unless they were experiencing side-effects attributed to the drug. Patients could return to 100/20mg if they could not tolerate 125/30mg, <em>but</em> they could not return to 125/30mg afterwards. Dose reductions could not be made in the final 2 weeks of the study.</p><p>This seems well designed and prevents the sort of situation where the dosage range covers 4 commonly prescribed strengths and then the authors shrug their shoulders at you when you ask which one was most effective.</p><p>Patients were required to remain in an inpatient setting for the duration of treatment, and — as far as I can tell — they would’ve received care as usual on these units. There is no indication that either group received special attention or interventions beyond the check-ins for assessment on various metrics and side-effect screening.</p><p>Additional medications were not permitted without prior approval of the investigator, except in “medical emergencies.” Up to 6mg of lorazepam equivalents were permitted as prns for anxiety, agitation, and insomnia; z-drugs were also permitted as prn sleep aids.</p><p>The fact that these patients needed to be kept on an inpatient unit for <strong>at least</strong> 5 weeks is pretty rough, and makes you wonder how often agitation events resulted in IM antipsychotic administration in “medical emergencies.” They did keep records for these sorts of things, but they did not make the data available in any of the supplements, so we just have to guess. There is a lot of incentive to not use antidopaminergics (because it would make the placebo effect much bigger) so we’ll just have to trust that the investigators thought about this and avoided using them in substantial quantities.</p><h3>Demographics</h3><p>It’s a short table so I’ll just put it in here:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

8.4-point greater reduction from baseline to week 5 in PANSS total score compared with placebo; the LS mean (SE) change from baseline to week 5 in PANSS total score was −20.6 (1.6) in the xanomeline-trospium group compared with −12.2 (1.6) in the placebo group (LS mean difference, −8.4; 95% CI, −12.4 to −4.3; P < .001; Cohen d effect size, 0.60)</p></blockquote><p>Before I start commenting, I want to put a big disclaimer up here. <strong>THE ONLY DATA WE HAVE GOES OUT TO 5 WEEKS - MAYBE THINGS LOOK BETTER AFTER 5 WEEKS. MAYBE THEY LOOK WORSE. PLEASE DO NOT WRITE ME ANGRY EMAILS TELLING ME THAT I AM A PHARMA SHILL/TOO MEAN TO BIG PHARMA BECAUSE I DIDN’T ACCOUNT FOR THIS. Thank you.</strong></p><h4>That’s A Nice Placebo Effect You’ve Got There</h4><p>First, that’s a big placebo effect size! I thought that maybe this was some sort of issue unique to this study, but it turns out that antipsychotic effect sizes have been staying the same while placebo effect sizes have been creeping up. People in the field have been aware of this for at <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig-Mallinckrodt/publication/44803566_Signal_Detection_and_Placebo_Response_in_Schizophrenia_Parallels_with_Depression/links/544a3fe10cf2f6388084fd55/Signal-Detection-and-Placebo-Response-in-Schizophrenia-Parallels-with-Depression.pdf\">least a 15 years</a> and it makes perfect sense that they would be. If drug effect sizes have been staying roughly the same, but placebo effect sizes keep creeping up, that poses a big problem when you try and convince the FDA to let you bring new treatments to market!</p><p>Stefan Leucht<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> — who else? — <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920996418302664\">has a paper discussing this very issue</a> for the antipsychotics, though it’s also an issue <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02638-x\">across all of psychiatry</a>. They found that for every 10 years between the publishing date of two papers, placebo response increases by 2.74 points on average. They find (and speculate on) a lot of reasons for this increase: increase number of study sites; use of the PANSS instead of the BPRS; shorter washout periods — the list goes on, though none of them account for more than ~10% of the heterogeneity observed.</p><h4>Onset Of Effect is Comparable to the Antidopaminergics</h4><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png\" width=\"498\" height=\"334.48773841961855\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":493,\"width\":734,\"resizeWidth\":498,\"bytes\":36025,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbdd432-4fe3-4ef7-92f3-16c5795f24a9_734x493.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Figure 2(a): <em>a = p<0.05, b = p<0.01, c = p<0.001</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you look at that figure above, you see that xanomeline/trospium statistically separates from placebo at the 2 week mark, and that the improvement in PANSS scores are a little more than half of what they are at week 5.</p><p>This is pretty similar<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1413955/\"> to the antidopaminergics</a>, where >50% of all improvement is seen in the first 2 weeks.

From this vantage, xanomeline actually <em>underperforms</em> the antidopaminergics by a decent amount at this PANSS score.</p><p>Is it a clinically relevant amount? I’m tempted to think so. You’d expect a 20 point reduction in PANSS scores with an antidopaminergic; 11.5 points better than xanomeline did here.</p><p>However, if you just look at the positive symptom subscore improvement, xanomeline performs the same as the antidopaminergics (d = 0.80 vs. d = 0.83) based on a baseline PANSS of 100. So where does it look like the discrepancy comes from?</p><h4>Negative Symptoms and Cognition, Surprisingly</h4><p>There’s something of a myth that the antidopaminergics don’t treat the negative symptoms of schizophrenia at all, when in reality their effect sizes are just more modest relative to improvements in positive symptoms. In any case, given the previous improvements in cognition seen with xanomeline, there was hope that it might improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and/or show cognitive benefits not seen with the antidopaminergics.</p><p>In this study, xanomeline briefly separated from placebo in negative subscores at week 4, but this significance disappeared at week 5. Xanomeline reduced PANSS negative scores by a mere -0.8 points (95% CI -1.9 to 0.2, P = 0.12; Cohen’s d = 0.23) relative to placebo.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"391.2189616252822\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":636,\"width\":886,\"resizeWidth\":545,\"bytes\":66445,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdbaf17b-b6d1-42dc-ba77-681f25af3e2d_886x636.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There’s maybe something there, though even if we assume it’s real, a less than 2 point improvement isn’t exactly impressive.

Xanomeline’s effect size is only half that of olanzapine’s, for example.</p><p>Cognition was an exploratory endpoint — along with change in baseline prolactin, response based on SNP schizophrenia subtypes and SNPs related to KarXT metabolism. They performed an automated neuropsych battery at baseline, Day 21, and Day 32 of the study. None of the exploratory endpoints were reported so I can’t draw any firm conclusions about why there’s no cognitive data, though you’d think it’s the sort of thing that they would have included in this paper if the readouts were positive.</p><h3>Side Effects</h3><p>The antidopaminergic antipsychotics have a lot of side-effects. Some, like cognitive blunting, can exacerbate some of the worse symptoms of the disease itself. Others, like tardive dyskinesia can leave patients stuck with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw74dizv53o\">very noticeable, involuntary facial tics</a> for the rest of their lives, even if they stop taking the medication! More mundane side-effects include things like: olanzapine increasing your risk of developing diabetes by 3x; gaining lots of weight; orthostatic hypotension; sedation… the list goes on.</p><p>Xanomeline is not like this at all. Amazingly, its side-effects in this study were mostly limited to:</p><ul><li><p>Mild/moderate gastrointestinal side-effects within the first 2 weeks of treatment that disappear with time.</p></li><li><p>Very small increases in BP (2-3mmHg) that peaked after 1 week of treatment</p></li><li><p>An increase in supine heart rate of ~10-13 bpm that decreased with time</p></li></ul><p>No akathisia, no acute dystonia, no weight gain, no QTc prolongation (<a href=\"https://polypharmacy.substack.com/p/stop-twisting-yourself-into-knots\">which doesn’t matter anyway</a>). They also didn’t see any Parkinsonian symptoms or TD, and even though both generally take longer than 5 weeks in the antidopaminergics, the lack of dystonia and akathisia suggest that xanomeline isn’t screwing with nigrostriatal dopamine transmission very much.</p><p>If you’re wondering how much work the word “mostly” is doing before that list above… not much actually.

It’s dosed BID in strengths of 100/20mg or 125/30mg and should be available starting sometime in October of 2024.</p><p><em><strong>At five weeks</strong></em><strong> </strong>it looks to be modestly less effective in reducing overall PANSS scores relative to the antidopaminergic antipsychotics — d = 0.60 vs. d = 0.83 at a baseline PANSS of 100. It performs comparably when looking at just the positive subscores, but it seems to be significantly worse at improving negative subscores relative to best-in-class antidopaminergics like clozapine and olanzapine.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, xanomeline’s side-effect profile is where it stands out. Assuming there aren’t any nasty surprises waiting for us at the end of the long-term trials or distinct sub-populations with markedly different responses, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it supplant the SGAs as first-line for schizophrenia in the same way that the SRIs/SNRIs replaced the TCAs and MAOIs in all but the sickest patients.</p><p>That said, there are <em>a lot</em> of unanswered questions that we will need to see to further clarify xanomeline/trospium’s clinical role.</p><p>The biggest is of course <em><strong>what are its effects in the long term (i.e. past 5 weeks)?</strong></em> You probably noticed that in the graphs above, improvements in PANSS scores in the treatment group did not appear to have hit a plateau — you can see this quite well in the graph for the positive subscale:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png\" width=\"504\" height=\"354\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":354,\"width\":504,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":19631,\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe50362c5-f0b6-4d80-a2f7-c0d4ea752b7e_504x354.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The slope has just <em>barely</em> started to flatten out, which I think is quite promising!

Those are new, and I note them to myself as the boy, whose name is Tomas, brushes back the bangs that have grown long during the months we’ve been on the road. His face is pale and his eyes are very wide. He didn’t use to be this nervous when we did this. Months ago he would hold the gun and point it at me in toyish delight, utterly prepared and utterly faithful. He is beginning to suspect the truth. Perhaps he deduced it for himself, or simply read online about my methods.</p><p>The camera flashes are bright, so Tomas moves into the folds of the heavy curtains behind me. The news teams and reporters will not stop chattering and adjusting their equipment. This is my first live televised event and the media do not know how to treat me. It is said that my tricks cannot be real, must not be real. People are unsure what to do with true miracles.</p><p>I turn to the cameras, kneeling now, while signaling Tomas to come up behind me, the curtains winging closed. My frame, even on my knees, hides him in the shadows. The cameras cannot see him as he raises the gun and presses the muzzle, which is quite cold, against the back of my head. Each time I feel that rounded pressure it consumes my world, drawing me in, down, away. I have to fight to ignore it and concentrate on the act.</p><p>“This is no trick. It is real magic. I am now going to teleport an elephant on camera in front of a live audience. There are weight sensors on each platform. I have invited several prominent skeptics here today. There will be no smoke, no mirrors. Just teleportation. There will be only this elephant, which is now on platform one, and then, in an instant, it will be on platform two.” </p><p>The crowd hushes itself. There are no spotlights, no mist or fog, no hidden contraptions, no distractions. I can hear Tomas breathing at my back. I clear my throat. The cold circle of the gun grows larger and larger in my mind.</p><p>“Three. Two. One.” </p><p>The air claps like thunder as it fills the vacuum where the elephant was.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>I could, of course, give you backstory. Loads of it, and quite poignant too—my father, out on oil rigs for months at a time in far corners of the world. My mother, long dead. My fault, in a way. I would stay with my aunt, a rounding woman whose children were appropriately mountainous, and I, merely a thin reed who disappeared amid those hurricanes of movement and noise. I barely talked to any of my cousins, except sometimes the eldest brother. He gave me boxes of his old comic books, and he was the reason I read <em>The X-Men</em>, <em>Spiderman</em>, <em>The Swamp Thing</em>, <em>Batman</em>, <em>Superman</em>, and especially <em>Doctor Strange</em>. In my room I spent hours staring at lamps, pens, figurines, bottle caps, trapped insects buzzing inside bottles, trying to make them move. I was sure that my lack of remarkable traits was a mistake, a cosmic blunder. But I did learn how to make it seem like things vanished. I learned sleight of hand, and each time I sat on my bed alone and lifted the top card of the deck and saw the card I had selected earlier I felt the tiniest thrill of impossibility.</p><p>When my father came home I could feel his detachment, his wonderment at having raised a son like this. I knew he was unnerved by the way I stood and watched, the way I hovered at the entrances of rooms, never seeming to enter. He felt there was something of an insect about me, like a moth stilling itself. An older patience.</p><p>Ultimately, this is why my backstory matters little. I am inexplicable and unique. The human moth.</p><p>The backstory of my magic, however, matters quite a lot. Its origin is in the local library, which became my fortress of solitude, reading at first comic books, then later, popular science. At state college I ambitiously decided to study physics, thinking it would be a community where my social awkwardness wouldn’t matter. This proved a disappointment. I couldn’t do the math, and provoked only middling support from my professors.</p><p>I applied to twelve graduate school programs but didn’t get into any of them. So I returned to live at my father’s house and worked at a local deli ringing in orders. I practiced magic in my room and began putting my first show together. On the bus to work I still occasionally read physics papers.</p><p>It was while reading on the bus that I came across a 1987 paper by Hans Moravec. In it he proposed a thought experiment called “quantum suicide.” It’s a version of the famous Schrödinger’s Cat thought experiment, where a cat is put in a box with some method of releasing poison gas if a Geiger counter clicks. The Geiger counter picks up atomic decay, which, in the box at least, is totally random. According to the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum physics, two universes branch at each moment that the Geiger counter could or could not click. In one universe, the cat dies. In the other universe the cat lives. But Hans Moravec imagined instead that a person climbs into the box, not a cat. As the multiverse splits, one version of the person lives while the other dies from the poison gas. Consciousness, by definition, always continues on in the one who lives. So to a person who climbs into the box it seems like the Geiger counter never clicks. Your consciousness automatically defaults to the universe in which the poison is never released. You are by definition only aware in the worlds where you do not die, and by the rules of quantum physics, there are always worlds in which you do not die.</p><p>I began to think about the thought experiment incessantly, like digging at a scab. And the comic books continued to pile up in loose stacks throughout my room. </p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>The quantum suicide thought experiment has a strange punch-line. If a truck is speeding toward you there are some universes where the bus simply goes through you. It is a cosmically rare event for a solid object to phase through another unharmed, but according to quantum physics, it can happen. Of course, in most universes you die. But your consciousness, by definition, continues only in the very few improbable ones where you live, the ones in which the truck, by some incredibly unlikely outcome of waveform collapse, passes through you like a ghost. So you never die. You <em>never</em> die. Every time you are about to die, it seems to you that some incredibly improbable event saves your life. Think about the times in your life where you slammed the breaks down just in time, or caught hold of a railing before falling down the steps. Did versions of you not? How many times have versions of you pulled out into the street without looking? Or hit your head on the concrete bottom of a pool when diving. Or choked while eating alone? Perhaps you are the beneficiary of a great cosmic irony without knowing it.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>I found Tomas because I could not do it myself. Holding the gun to my head in a hotel room, I swore I would pull the trigger if the card at the top of the randomly-shuffled deck didn’t come up the way I wanted it to. I could hear the murmurs and laugh-track of the television next door through the wall. I had performed my first stage magic act earlier that night. The audience had left in a small trickle throughout the show. The lights had been murderously hot, and I had stinging sweat in my eyes at the end when I retreated behind the curtain and sunk to the floor.</p><p>In my hotel room I swore and cursed and promised myself I would do it and cocked the gun and put it to my temple and raged and then counted down. The laugh-track from the neighboring room sounded through the thin walls. And I didn’t pull the trigger. I couldn’t. </p><p>But someone else could. Someone who didn’t know the consequences. Tomas was a ward of the state who I met at a magic shop. I fed him popsicles and let him leaf through my comic books. He had a mop of wheat-colored hair and constantly sticky fingers. I told him I would take him far away from his guardians, that it would be like running away with the circus. I told him I would show him real magic.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>The elephant appears with a low moan and a creak of wood on the second platform. There are screams and gasps from the audience, and then a thunderous applause. It is the first time my act has been on national television. It will not be the last. I like the feeling of knowing that people are sitting at their couches, their chairs, their kitchen tables, watching and wishing they could do what I do. They could, of course. They just don’t have the courage.</p><p>I turn and take the gun from Tomas’s hands. He is smiling a gap-toothed smile from the darkness of the curtains. I brush his hair aside and pocket the compact gun. </p><p>The praise of the journalists means nothing to me. When I see myself on the television later that night I look like an insect stuffed inside a magician’s outfit. My skin is pale and pathetic and patchy fuzz rings my chin. My fingers are long and I notice that when I talk they move around me on their own.</p><p>I care only that I am a superhero. That I am The Moth.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>My reign as the greatest living magician was spent mostly hiding out in my trailer, never staying in one place for more than a few days at a time. I would put on impromptu shows and let them be captured by camera-phones and circulated on the Internet. The Moth became a national hero, a villain, a legend, part of American mythology.</p><p>Of course, eventually my secret got out. All superheroes have their identity revealed. All magic tricks are explained, especially if they really are magic. A famous physicist and skeptic figured it out and wrote several articles about my methods. He explained that at each act there is a small chance that the magic trick I wish to perform at that moment would occur via a very improbable quantum waveform collapse, a trillion in a trillion chance. The card comes up my way. Or the elephant, in some astronomically improbable universe, actually gets teleported. What I do is simply eliminate myself from all of the universes in which my magic trick does not happen. So I always end up in one where the trick occurred.</p><p>Let me put it plainly: I commit suicide if my trick doesn’t work. Thus by default my consciousness ends up only in one of the universes in which the immensely improbable event, the trick, actually happened. I make correlation look like causation. I use the axiom that I cannot die to demand the impossible of reality.</p><p>It is strange to only live in the improbable worlds. Once I was teleported instead of the elephant, and Tomas’s bullet whizzed past my ear and cut a hole in the far side of the circus tent. He dropped the gun as the crowd panicked, his eyes wide and rolling in fear. In whatever universe I was in he had never seen the gun go off before.</p><p>That same night Tomas told me he wouldn’t do it anymore. He told me had figured it out, that it all made sense now, that it was horrible. That he was a murderer. I told him I could show him how it worked, that it would all be okay. We were in our trailer, which was full of red velvet, tassels and beads, and dirty dishes. He raged against me and pounded my chest and then clung to me as if drowning. I told him it would all be all right and went to the lockbox and got out the handgun, which I loaded while he rocked back and forth in a corner. He saw me loading it and tried to stand and run but I moved to the door and blocked it and he retreated to the back of the trailer, lowing like an animal. I hushed him and held the pistol to his head and told him that it was alright, he was going to be fine, we were all going to be fine. I shuffled the deck. I asked him what the top card was. He wouldn’t answer for hours. But he finally did, exhausted. And then I was nearly deaf and covered in hot splatter, like heated oil.</p><p>I buried him in the New Jersey woods in a small and shallow grave. His tiny body was surprisingly heavy and it hurt my back to dig so much. I was not upset. I knew that he had gotten the answer right in some universe. Now he could go on to be god of his own little worlds.</p><p>If you’re horrified I ask you this: how precisely did it matter?</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Six months after my national debut, in a garage in Maine, surrounded by medical alcohol, bright lamps, and the thin alien silver of surgical instruments, a doctor I bribed installed a home-made laser into the back of my skull, aimed at my brain. I can still reach up and feel it, a rough and jagged scar where the hair never grew back. This is how one becomes a superhero.</p><p>Brian, my new boy, could just sit in the crowd and hold the remote. I stopped bullets in midair shot at me by audience members. I lifted and threw a truck thirty feet in Times Square. I gave the President of the United States a heart attack and then stopped it with a click of my fingers on national television.</p><p>To be able to do what no one else can do, to actually have superpowers, is like inhaling the sun. There are rules, of course. Don’t demand things which fall outside the rules of quantum mechanics. Random events are the easiest, like winning the lottery (I didn’t even bother to claim the money). Making others drop dead. Teleportation is okay, under the right conditions. But things must be visible and discernible to the one pulling the trigger. Sometimes this is especially difficult.</p><p>When they brought the body of the girl to me I knew that I was going to perform the greatest magic trick. Christ’s trick. Brian held the remote to my skull laser and I knelt down in front of her gray and rubbery skin. Phones were held up to record the scene. There were protestors outside, holding signs which said that what I did was illegal, inhumane. They had pelted my car with eggs and rocks when my driver pulled up. They screamed I was going to die. They screamed I would make someone a murderer. But there are no laws concerning what I do.</p><p>The girl’s name had been Shelley. I laid my hands on her cold chest and I counted to three and then a scream burst from the dead girl’s mouth and she flushed with color and rocketed upright, vomiting a black substance composed of the river bed she’d been found in. As horrified yells and spoken prayers echoed from the audience the girl flayed upwards, her fleshy, still-swollen body falling off the platform. Her family members ran up, crying her name. And so, for a brief moment, I was truly Jesus Christ. The greatest of superheroes.</p><p>Of course, the thing inside was not Shelley. As the days went on and all she did was moan and rock back and forth and refuse to eat the family accused me of returning a random idiot to them, an animal. On CNN Shelley’s mother said that the thing now in Shelley’s body didn’t know the family, had tried to bite them. She said it had eaten their cat.</p><p>I told Brian it was his fault, even though I knew it wasn’t. Asking the boy to distinguish between when I brought back something and when I brought back Shelley was too complicated.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>The reason my trick is the best magic trick that has ever been invented is that no one else can ever imitate it. Of course, I have seen people try. And I have watched them die, always horribly, on stage. I saw a man drown in a swimming tank. I saw another hang himself. Jokingly, some copy-cat magicians passed out raincoats to those in the front row, for the blood splatter. The attention the press and public paid to magic skyrocketed. It was a national trend. But the probability of me ending up in a universe where another performer survives the trick is miniscule. The trick only works from the first-person perspective. But when they die I never laugh. I always pay them respect, in my way.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>When the police finally come for me I let them into my trailer with almost relief. My knee aches, and I walk with a hunch. One eye is gone and only a tender scar remains from where the bullet skimmed against the surface of my skull and came out the socket. Electric burns run down my neck. I have a guarantee of never dying, but no promise as to what the continuation will be. Maiming is possible in my strange worlds, even, I’m beginning to understand, more likely than not.</p><p>So when they storm into my trailer with a warrant I am lying amid the dirty piles of clothes and dishes. Tyler was never as good at cleaning as the others, and in this universe I killed him a few weeks back, so the troopers have to kick aside rotting take-out food boxes and tangled robes to get to me. They take me limping to a police cruiser and call me a monster. They still do not understand what I’ve demonstrated, what it means for them.</p><p>I’m accused of four counts of first degree murder. A hiker found the little rows of graves in the woods. There are actually six, two that I put into landfills at night, but who’s counting? I taught them all real magic, in the end, and anyways they’re all fine in their own worlds.</p><p>The jury obviously found me guilty, although my lawyer got them to consider me criminally insane. The very idea of being imprisoned for a duration of time is laughable to me. As if the normal concepts of life and death applied to anyone, let alone me, and were not just collaborative illusions. </p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Now I wake every day only to stare at the ceiling, relieving myself in tubes. Every movement is pain. I am covered in scars and burns, which run up and down my torso. My legs, which are prosthetics, tremble. Just shifting my weight in my bed hurts. I have been here for decades, perhaps centuries. I don’t know anymore. Cancer has debilitated me without killing me. They won’t let me out of my room. I can’t remember the last time I was outside. They say I am insane.</p><p>I need a gun. I am full of courage now. I am sure I could do it, that I could hold it to my head and pull the trigger. I could make the walls disappear and escape. I could make the orderlies drop dead from heart attacks. I just need a gun.</p><p>It’s taken decades but everyone has forgotten me. The rules have gotten lax. A young boy has begun to come by, and I’ve started talking to him as much as I can still talk. His name is Jonas and he is autistic. An orderly told me years ago that most children are autistic now. Jonas’s mother is incarcerated here too. I gave him some of my Jello. He told me about his father and his collection of old guns. I told him I will show him a magic trick if he brings me one of his father’s guns. I will show him the greatest magic trick he has ever seen. I will show him an old man who becomes young again. </p><p>Now I wait for the gun and plan. This time around, my ambitions will be far grander. With this long invalidism with which to mull things over, I have grown detached from the word “superhero.” I’ve found a word with a more enticing ring instead: “God Emperor.”</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

genes in an autistic child and provoking a series of (ultimately fatal) physical and neurological changes. The company responsible for this discovery presented its findings after extensive follow-up studies on inmates of the Texas penal system; a recording of that talk, complete with visual aids, is available online<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>; curious readers with half an hour to kill are referred there for details not only on vampire biology, but on the research, funding, and \"ethical and political concerns\" regarding vampire domestication (not to mention the ill-fated \"Taming Yesterday's Nightmares For A Brighter Tomorrow\" campaign). The following (much briefer) synopsis restricts itself to a few biological characteristics of the ancestral organism:</p><p><em>Homo sapiens vampiris</em> was a short-lived Human subspecies which diverged from the ancestral line between 800,000 and 500,000 year BP. More gracile than either <em>neandertal</em> or <em>sapiens</em>, gross physical divergence from <em>sapiens</em> included slight elongation of canines, mandibles, and long bones in service of an increasingly predatory lifestyle. Due to the relatively brief lifespan of this lineage, these changes were not extensive and overlapped considerably with conspecific allometries; differences become diagnostically significant only at large sample sizes (N>130).</p><p>However, while virtually identical to modern humans in terms of gross physical morphology, <em>vampiris</em> was radically divergent from <em>sapiens</em> on the biochemical, neurological, and soft-tissue levels. The GI tract was foreshortened and secreted a distinct range of enzymes more suited to a carnivorous diet. Since cannibalism carries with it a high risk of prionic infection<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>, the vampire immune system displayed great resistance to prion diseases<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a>, as well as to a variety of helminth and anasakid parasites. <em>Vampiris</em> hearing and vision were superior to that of <em>sapiens</em>; vampire retinas were quadrochromatic (containing four types of cones, compared to only three among baseline humans); the fourth cone type, common to nocturnal predators ranging from cats to snakes, was tuned to near-infrared. Vampire grey matter was \"underconnected\" compared to Human norms due to a relative lack of interstitial white matter; this forced isolated cortical modules to become self-contained and hypereffective, leading to omnisavantic pattern-matching and analytical skills.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p><p>Virtually all of these adaptations are cascade effects that— while resulting from a variety of proximate causes— can ultimately be traced back to a paracentric inversion mutation on the Xq21.3 block of the X-chromosome.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> This resulted in functional changes to genes coding for protocadherins (proteins that play a critical role in brain and central nervous system development). While this provoked radical neurological and behavioral changes, significant physical<em> </em>changes were limited to soft tissue and microstructures that do not fossilise. This, coupled with extremely low numbers of vampire even at peak population levels (existing as they did at the tip of the trophic pyramid) explains their virtual absence from the fossil record.</p><p>Significant deleterious effects also resulted from this cascade. For example, vampires lost the ability to code for alpha-Protocadherin Y, whose genes are found exclusively on the hominid Y chromosome.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a> Unable to synthesise this vital protein themselves, vampires had to obtain it from their food. Human prey thus comprised an essential component of their diet, but a relatively slow-breeding one (a unique situation, since prey usually outproduce their predators by at least an order of magnitude). Normally this dynamic would be utterly unsustainable: vampires would predate humans to extinction, and then die off themselves for lack of essential nutrients.</p><p>Extended periods of lungfish-like dormancy<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> (the so-called \"undead\" state)—and the consequent drastic reduction in vampire energetic needs— developed as a means of redressing this imbalance. To this end vampires produced elevated levels of endogenous Ala-(D) Leuenkephalin (a mammalian hibernation-inducing peptide<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a>) and dobutamine, which strengthens the heart muscle during periods on inactivity.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><p>Another deleterious cascade effect was the so-called \"Crucifix Glitch\"— a cross-wiring of normally-distinct receptor arrays in the visual cortex<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a>, resulting in <em>grand mal</em>-like feedback seizures whenever the arrays processing vertical and horizontal stimuli fired simultaneously across a sufficiently large arc of the visual field. Since intersecting right angles are virtually nonexistent in nature, natural selection did not weed out the Glitch until <em>H. sapiens sapiens</em> developed Euclidean architecture; by then, the trait had become fixed across <em>H. sapiens vampiris</em> via genetic drift, and—suddenly denied access to its prey—the entire subspecies went extinct shortly after the dawn of recorded history.</p><p>You'll have noticed that Jukka Sarasti, like all reconstructed vampires, sometimes <em>clicked</em> to himself when thinking. This is thought to hail from an ancestral language, which was hardwired into a click-speech mode more than 50,000 years BP. Click-based speech is especially suited to predators stalking prey on savannah grasslands (the clicks mimic the rustling of grasses, allowing communication without spooking quarry).<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-11\" href=\"#footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a> The Human language most closely akin to Old Vampire is Hadzane<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-12\" href=\"#footnote-12\" target=\"_self\">12</a></p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

It has a particular affinity for the regions surrounding the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus\">suprachiasmatic nucleus </a>— the brain’s central pacemaker. From this location, <em>N. temporalis </em>secretes a cocktail of peptides that interact with the host’s circadian rhythm regulation.</p><p>These peptides modulate the expression of clock genes — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_circadian_protein_homolog_1\">Per1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER2\">Per2</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER3\">Per3</a> — effectively altering the host’s internal perception of time.</p><p>Specifically, the primary symptom of <em>N. temporalis</em> infection is a gradual shift in circadian rhythm, overriding typical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber\">zeitgebers</a> that modulate the host’s internal clock. Infected individuals typically experience extending their perceived day to 27-30 hours, creating a constant misalignment with the Earth’s 24-hour cycle. This leads to chronic jet-lag-like symptoms, including sleep disturbances, metabolic irregularities, and cognitive impairments.</p><p>Through this disruption of its host’s circadian rhythm, the parasite creates a state of immune fatigue. Infected individuals become increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections, especially those caused by normally benign microorganisms present in the environment. Common ailments such as upper respiratory infections, skin conditions, and gastrointestinal disturbances become more frequent and severe.</p><p><em>N. temporalis</em> feeds on <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269202/\">cerebrospinal fluid microbes</a>, which thrive due to host immune suppression. Its life cycle alternates between active feeding periods, where it disrupts the host’s circadian rhythm, and dormant phases when the host normalizes. As its food depletes, the parasite reactivates, again releasing peptides to alter the host’s rhythm and boost microbial growth, renewing its food source.</p><p>This cycle of feeding, dormancy, and reactivation continues indefinitely, creating a long-term pattern of alternating disrupted and normal circadian rhythms in the host. Due to its difficulty of diagnosis and impact on mental health, human hosts often display anxiety, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>Given the appearance of the parasite in infants as young as two months, <em>N. temporalis</em> is believed to originate as a parasite within the mother, which ends up infecting a developing embryo. However, it is likely that this infection is unintentional, as <em>N. temporalis</em> is both rare and dies with its host. It is unknown what the original parasite or what its effect on the mother is.</p><h1>Pulmo extremophilus</h1><p><em>Pulmo extremophilus</em> is a bacterium that primarily inhabits the lungs of humans, with a particular affinity for alveolar spaces. <em>P. extremophilus</em> interacts with the host’s respiratory system through a biochemical mechanism that influences gas exchange, respiratory drive, and, in the latest stages, behaviors.</p><p>Upon infection, the parasite first secretes a cocktail of compounds that modulate alveolar function and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_chemoreceptors\">central chemoreceptor</a> sensitivity. These secretions include a surfactant-mimicking protein that alters<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539825/\"> alveolar surface tension</a>, alongside a peptide that alters <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4802370/\">central chemoreceptor sensitivity to blood gas levels.</a></p><p>The primary effect of <em>P. extremophilus</em> infection is a gradual reduction in alveolar gas exchange efficiency due its impact on alveoli. Infected individuals typically experience a <a href=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/oxygen-saturation-914796\">7% decrease in oxygen uptake,</a> creating a chronic state of mild hypoxia. And, as a result of the chemoreceptor alteration, the hypoxia goes largely unnoticed by the host. This eventually causes <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-020-0227-y\">natural adaptations amongst red blood cell populations</a>, leading to a greater ability to withstand said hypoxia.</p><p>Within a few months after initial infection, <em>P. extremophilus</em> further releases a cocktail of chemical compounds that interact with the hosts central nervous system. It is uncharacterized exactly what the neurophysiological impact of these compounds are — likely<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2015180\"> NMDA receptor antagonism</a> — but, following its release, late-stage infected hosts have been observed to frequently engage in a wide variety of high-risk athletic behavior. Amongst the most prevalent ones are free solo climbing, wingsuit flying, and high-altitude climbs.</p><p>The initial athletic aptitude afforded to them by the hypoxia adaptations frequently leads to early success in athletic endeavors, reinforcing the host’s drive to pursue extreme sports and exploration. In time, the host inevitably suffers a fatal injury for reasons of risks inherent to the sport itself.</p><p>Once the parasite senses dangerously low blood oxygen levels, it will release respiratory irritants, causing the host to violently cough, coating their mouth with expelled bacteria. Upon host death, the parasite enters a state of hibernation, only releasing spores when its host body is disturbed. <em>P. extremophilus</em> primary route of infection is oral, so passersby or medical teams who disturb the corpse are typically the next to be infected.</p><h1>Opticomyces occultans</h1><p><em>Opticomyces occultans</em> is a fungus that colonizes the optic nerve of humans living in rural areas with high amounts of nearby wildlife. The parasite induces blindness to hyper-specific visual stimuli.</p><p>Upon initial infection on the outer surface of the optic nerve, typically via nasal spores, the fungus secretes acidic substances to slowly cut its way through the nerve. Over the course of a year, the fungus replaces a segment of the optic nerve with itself. During this period, the host will experience intermittent bouts of mild eye pain and visual noise, but rarely anything more severe.</p><p>Once established within the optic nerve, <em>O. occultans</em> acts as a highly selective filter for visual information. The fungus allows most visual signals to pass through unaltered but is also capable of detecting specific distributions of light via stacked <a href=\"http://photosensitive/\">photosensitive proteins</a>. If these sets of proteins are sufficiently activated — typically through<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697613/\"> conformational changes</a> — they will cause downstream signal cascades, rapid alternating the input light signal before re-transmitting it along the optic nerve. This modification process occurs in less than 200 milliseconds, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456887/\">which is faster than the average human visual reaction time</a>. As a result, the host remains mostly unaware of any manipulation of their visual input.</p><p><em>O. occultans</em> imperfectly alters visual stimuli, but consistently causes infected hosts to misperceive images of large carnivores, often interpreting them as blurs. In areas with high human infection rates, <em>O. occultans</em> spores have been found in the feces of lions, bears, and leopards. This suggests these predators may serve as secondary hosts in the parasite’s life cycle. Researchers hypothesize that <em>O. occultans</em> visual alterations in humans aim to increase the likelihood of predation.</p><h1>Endocrinus empathetica</h1><p><em>Endocrinus empathetica</em> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa\">protozoan</a> which primarily resides in the human gut, feeds on ingested food, and impacts social behavior and emotional processing. It is typically found only in third-world nations with inaccessible medical systems and a lack of sanitization practices.</p><p>After several months of infection, the parasite secretes large amounts of oxytocin and vasopressin — hormones crucial for social bonding, trust, and empathetic behaviors. Simultaneously, <em>E. empathetica</em> produces a compound that acts as an antagonist to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid_receptor\">glucocorticoid receptors</a>, effectively lowering the host’s fear response.</p><p>The combined effect of increased prosocial hormones and decreased stress response leads to notable behavioral changes in infected individuals. Symptomatically, they typically display increased empathy, improved emotional resilience, and a tendency towards more cooperative behaviors. Amongst the infected, researchers have observed shifts in social structures, with them often assuming leadership or mediator roles within their communities.</p><p>In time, the constant release of the aforementioned chemicals eventually leads to host endocrine burnout and depression. Given their status, the host typically receives constant palliative care from rotating members of the community. <em>E. empathetica </em>route of transmission is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal%E2%80%93oral_route\">fecal-oral</a>, and untrained caretakers of the host will frequently accidentally infect themselves while handling the parasite-containing excrement of the host.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Seeds of Science is a reader-supported publication.

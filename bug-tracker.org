* Bug Tracker

The GNU Bug Tracker at https://debbugs.gnu.org. Emacs bugs are filed
in the tracker under the ‘emacs’ package. The tracker records
information about the status of each bug, the initial bug report, and
the follow-up messages by the bug reporter and Emacs developers. You
can search for bugs by subject, severity, and other criteria.

Instead of browsing the bug tracker as a webpage, you can browse it
from Emacs using the debbugs package, which can be downloaded via the
Package Menu (see Packages). This package provides the command M-x
debbugs-gnu to list bugs, and M-x debbugs-gnu-search to search for a
specific bug. User tags, applied by the Emacs maintainers, are shown
by M-x debbugs-gnu-usertags.
